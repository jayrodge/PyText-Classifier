Negative	Scratched disk: Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake.
Positive	Gossip Girl season 3: arrived a lot quicker than expected and was in condition that was stated. Thanks and I would buy from again!
Negative	Gossip Girl Boring: I dont get it,this is yet another show of wasted film.What is going on, rich kids, blah.INSTANT STAR on CTV Programming is not.Check INSTANT STAR out on the youtube.If you dont know about INSTANT STAR or Tommy & Jude maybe you should.
Negative	Never received my item: I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. They took my money and I still have received my item, money back, or feedback after emailing them nearly two weeks ago. I'm not ordering from them again.
Positive	Pretty good: I'm a coming-of-age genre fan, so Gossip Girl is right up my alley. The season started a little slowly, but it picked up pace toward the end. Mostly it was the same-old, same-old, just with grown-up clothing and with more serious consequences for actions. Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3.
Negative	The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show.: Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show. Seriously, how many times can Chuck and Blair get back together or a better question would be why s Michelle Tratchenberg returning at the end of every season?
Positive	RUh-Ruh-Ruh-roofis!!!!: Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!
Negative	Very disappointed: I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
Negative	UNDELIVERY: I've already complained twice because I've bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I've never received it. As I've never got a answer, I'm writting this comment. WhAT shoud I do? I'm waiting for so many months and no answer and no product
Negative	Don't use this company never got item: This company sucks. It's been a lil over a month and never received item. I never got response back from the company after I emailed the 4+ times. I'm also dissatisfied with Amazon and will never use them as well. All I've gotten is the run around. I want my money back so I can go on my way
Positive	Love GG: I'm a big Gossip Girl fan and thought season 3 was great! Loved seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6! 4 and 5 were okay. ;)
Positive	A change in attitude: For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Through this book I realized a good astrology reading is made up of the astrologer, the client, and astrology concepts. Astrology can not be tested or practiced as the machine of destiny: if you have X in Y you will be such and such.
Negative	"Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
Negative	Not Good Enough: I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well.
Negative	"The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
Positive	Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags.: I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
Negative	Not Worth the Trouble: You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest.
Negative	Tuner doesn't work well after 1 yr.: I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.
Negative	This card is terrible: I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it.
Positive	Exelente eleccion: Los mejores zapatos de futbol que he comprado en mi vida, funcionan perfecto para cesped artifical, cesped natural y piso duro.Lo recomiendo 100%
Negative	Poor Quality: I bought several of these for my daughters hoping that they would be like the one that I have used for the past 40 years. The design is the same, but the quality was terrible....way to flimsy, they didn't hold their shape (spring) for more than 5 minutes of use. I am greatly disappointed.
Positive	One of a kind: This is the most detailed bobble head I've ever seen. Its heavy, sturdy, all handpainted clothing, inscriptions on each pant leg, straight thizzface. I got one of the new Andre Macassi bobble heads and its a piece of crap compared to this one, which is why I'm guessing the Thizzelle Washington one was a limited edition of only 5000 handmade. Bummed these are sold out now, I need another one for my gameroom!!
Negative	"Terrible single: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
Positive	Wonderful work by a lesser known composer: Edward German's music evokes images of idyllic days in the English countryside. His works are not as well known as those of other English composers from the early 20th Century but you won't be disappointed if you are looking for music that raises the spirit and soothes the soul.
Positive	great book: i was having trouble in school and my mom gave me this book. it saved me, it is easy to read and really makes sense. i'd reccomend it to anyone having any trouble at all in high school
Negative	Conventional Wisdom for Morons: This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain.
Positive	Excellent: I found this book as well as Vaultreports very helpful for anyone hoping to succeed at shifting jobs or careers.
Positive	Rites of Passage: For great advice on what to expect when you work with a executive recuiter read chapters 7-10. Its worth the price of the book alone. Out of work high-level executives and those who want to make a solid change in their career need to read this book in order to sound smart and learn what to expect from good and bad headhunters.
Positive	You can't simply read the book, you have to use this workbook.: I read the book and loved it. When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms. Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store. But I was wrong. This book is really two books. The work book is designed to be cut into two different books. One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign. The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook. And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort. The rewards are great. This is a dynimite combination. He is really something else. I recommend this book very highly.
Positive	When you need orgainzation, this really helps: The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process.
Negative	"Do NOT buy this burner!: I ended up w/ this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD, which went toes up after about a month. Less than a year later, I have a completely useless burner that stalls at 6% and then freezes my entire system. After NUMEROUS emails and phone calls to TDK, I finally got ""authorization"" to send it in for replacement. I am so fed up, I am going to buy a Lite-On and wash my hands of it.Look elsewhere....this burner is not work the carboard box it is packaged in."
Positive	Kyra's Story: This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!
Positive	nakita's review: i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it.
Negative	another nickelodeon knock off: this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games; bad graphics, too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first. just as i did with 5 nickelodeon game boy games that were way overpriced. please dont be as stupid as i was...i suggest you DO NOT buy it.
Positive	Great First Game!!!: I bought this game at Best Buy and am glad I did! This game has good levels which are FUN games! I do think they need to add a couple more! Although it may look as though there is only multiplayer, there is a single game. One game which you squirt other players is REALLY hard to control! I don't think you are supposed to control the people! The level is really fun though. When you choose a player(s) the game chooses the other people you are playing against. The sound is really hard to hear but not bad if you turn up the volume. The graphics are okay. All and all I think this is a pretty good game!
Negative	Save your money: If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good, doesn't mean the game is.My 6 year-old doesn't like it.
Negative	How to raise the stress level in your house?-Buy Party Blast: This game is a piece of .... The system requirements on the box are misleading. It is tough to explain to a six year old that his brand new game can't be played until you upgrade your video card, even though no reference was made to it on the box.And when the game finally works it looks like a hybrid of 2000 technology meets 1977 graphics.
Negative	"Not worth your money: This game is ridiculously hard for a game with ""Nickelodeon"" on it. I was expecting something easy that my 5 yr old would like to play. Spongebob and Tommy let us down. Hard. Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money. I won't be taken in by the ""Nickelodeon"" name again."
Negative	Pretty bad: This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak.
Negative	TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT: I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!
Negative	Not what I expected: I was excited when I first saw this game. We are always looking for a game for our young children to play. There it just not enough games for young children on x-box. This game was a big disappointment! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing. There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player. It just was NOT FUN!
Negative	Not good: This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. It has horrible graphics and I don't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all.
Negative	Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics: We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.
Negative	Not what I expected.: Not what I expected. Too much acting. Disappointing to say the least. I will not buy the like again. Oh well.
Negative	Please don't buy this globe.: E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
Positive	Woo-Hoo!!!: The Christmas episodes are always the best. . .I have the other DVD of Christmas episodes of The Simpsons, and I love it! The Christmas episodes are the only ones I want to own on DVD, but it is nice having the other winter-themed episodes on the DVD along with the holiday episodes. I'm glad I don't have to spend $40 on a whole season of The Simpsons just for the one Christmas episode I want. I wish more tv shows had Christmas-only DVDs available.
Negative	Love the Simpsons, but this ain't Christmas.: Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here.
Negative	Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included.
Positive	the simpsons christmas 2: I love this dvd. The reason why I gave it a 4 is because in tis the 15th season, right at the end of act 2 my dvd skips to the end credits. Has any one else seen this problem?
Positive	Kinder But Less Impressive than Joshua: I read the first Joshua book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools. Overall this was a good book.
Positive	Joshua is a truely the most movig and inspiring I ever read: I'm not very old ut I think that this is by fare the best book I ever read.
Positive	joshua and the children: This was a wonderful and inspiring story. Words truly can strengthen our spirit. This book was filled with many heart warming words and important messages that can help in our daily living.
Positive	The story was very interesting and the book worth reading.: I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest. The one thing I did not like about the book was the counties that were mentioned are not counties of West Virginia. I am from WV. Charleston and Huntington were mentioned though which is accurage.
Positive	Chunky gamelan: Brassy, spectral percussion.Stark, intimate and boldly intense. Blooms of bicycle bell, musical box and every manner of metal chime, grungily recorded in an up close and personal fashion. Strange and indulgent, reveling in the sensuality of its own clank, scrack and visceral punch.For all it's minimalism this heady music is perfumed and exotic, richly harmonious and rippling with pulsating rhythm. Almost ecstatic, like medieval religious music.
Negative	"A disappointment: Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
Positive	Lots of up-to-date knots: It includes lots of up-to-date knots. You can find the knots you want in a easy way. Also, the knots are categorized by the uses of them by which you can find the common usage of those knots. Easy to use.
Negative	Its Blaaaaaaa: Its full of pitures and not what I thought it would of been. There are better books then this one I would pass it up if I had known.
Positive	Really usable: With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage. It is profusely illustrated with clear, easy-to-read photographs, and has easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. Covering everything from the most basic to the decorative, with suggestions for the use of each, it would be a practical and beautiful assistance for anyone who has always wanted to know how to tie those nifty knots.
Positive	This is a great book.: I just recently got into tying knots. This is a great book; the pictures are great and it gives good info to boot. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Positive	"Great book. Informative and well written.: Sometimes you need to ""tie the right knot"" at the right time, and this book helps a lot! Sometimes you need to tie two different size ropes together; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you keen a knot that will slip; this book has a knot for that. Sometimes you need a knot that does not slip; this book has a knot for that too! And what if you need to hang up / organize your extension cords...? Use the Fireman's Coil knot! Great book. Lots of color photos taken at each step."
Positive	Good Results: I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster
Positive	Wonderful: The story is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Sadly, the author passed away on October 8, 2002, so there won't be any more in the series.
Negative	"Cups are too thick and molded: The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."
Negative	Too small: It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered! So they run a lot smaller. It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling.
Negative	Cone Boobs: I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive.
Positive	"Nice Look, Not A Great Fit!: I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit. Sorry I can't say the same about the Carina bra.I agree with a previous reviewer, the cup size is off, not true to size and that results in ""spillage"". I bought the 40G, the straps are pretty and the lower back fits just perfect. The only con is the cup size, recommend ordering ""up"" one cup size when purchasing this particular bra."
Negative	Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support: The elastic used for the band very easily loses it's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). For a molded style, this bra loses it's use after a week. It's pretty but poorly engineered.
Positive	Sizing a little off..: I love the shaping this bra gives, but the straps sometimes pop out when I'm putting it on -- so annoying. It's also cut a little smaller than other Le Mystere bras in the band and the cup (think spillage). Otherwise, it's great and much better than any other convertible bra I've EVER tried!
Positive	Perfect Basic Bra: This bra is comfortable and creates a smooth silhouette under all kinds of clothes. It runs slightly small in the band, as usual in this brand, but the cup fits true to size.
Negative	Awful fit: I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
Positive	Nothing compares to Le Mystere bras: During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra.
Positive	My son loves this game!: I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!
Negative	Probably for Little Little Kids Only: Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)
Negative	Doesn't lock well: The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured.
Positive	"Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
Positive	I love this little guy!: I already had a larger combo square which I used like crazy, but for many applications having a smaller square is easier to use. I use it for marking board edges, for making sure my chisels and plane irons are square when sharpening them.... great buy for the price.
Positive	"Wonderful, inspirational, well done: I first saw this video 15 years ago when I was going through a transition phase of my life which started as a result of an injury. As I was just starting to push through the ""doom and gloom"" and take on new challenges, I found this video by chance. I was powerfully affected by its imagery and message. I watched it over and over, and really clicked with the symbol and image of the magestic bald eagle. To this day, the Eagle evokes in me an image of character, perserverence, courage, fortitude, strength and nobility that I aspire to in my life's roles. This video wonderfully depicts these timeless, universal themes that add purpose and meaning to our lives. I have shared this video with many through the years. I find that most people are ""wowed"" by it, and inspired to different degrees depending upon where they are in their own life journey."
Negative	Terrible motivational film: If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down.
Negative	Choices in Relationships: I requested the book 9th edition and you sent me a student review 4th edition. This is an activity manuel to accompany the book.
Negative	Badly Written and Boring: Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. A group of eighth graders could have written something better.The dialog is just plain stupid. I understand that the writer of this movie has gone back to working for a lawn maintenance company, and is given nothing more complicated than trimming shrubs.
Positive	Good replacement: Great product is exactly what it says. Good replacement for my mirror which was broken. It is slightly different on the inside but the exterior, after installation, is unnoticeable.
Positive	Beautiful, high quality necklace!: This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!
Negative	Plagued with problems: I bought a Radeon 8500 to replace my Radeon 7000. When I first installed it the performance and frame rate just blew me away. But then I found out that my card has problems running games and 3d apps. I got a headache from trying to fix it and I'm going to have to send it back to ATI for a replacement.
Negative	Causes computer to reboot: This card was big disappointment. I am using it on a dual Athlon MP system with Windows XP Pro. I have had repeated problems with the card causing my system to spontaneouesly reboot. Trying to play live video on a media player such as Windows Media Player or RealPlayer seems to be a particular problem. Applying repeated driver updates from ATI has not helped. The card is very fast, but the system stability issues are driving me crazy and have caused me to remove it from my computer. With a different card my system works great. I have have had good experiences with other ATI cards, but this card (or its drivers) are unstable.
Positive	great graphics for the money: great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go.
Positive	nice work ATI: ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card).
Positive	Radeon 8500 second chance: Well my previous review for this card was not good. But I just built a new, faster computer and put the Radeon to the test again. My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also. Worth the money-now that is.
Positive	"Never cease to AMAZE me: OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
Negative	"Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between: When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
Negative	Cheesy, boring, move on......: I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog.
Negative	Very poor story: The only good thing about this movie are the special effects. The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)
Negative	A Lame Ghost Wannabe: Very sad. If you must, rent the ORIGINAL Haunting--a very good flick. This film suffers from the Hollywood mentality: that special effects and big name actors can rescue a weak plot. Was there a single scare in the film? No. Was the ending telegraphed right from the start? Yes. CGI spirits do not make for chills.
Negative	possibly the worst haunted house movie made: This movie doesn't scare, it barely entertains and is frustrating to watch capable actors (Zita Jones and Nelson) in limited roles.The script is just plan bad, instead of showing realistic traditional ghost the producer decided to go with high dollar unrealistic special effects that are way overdone.I didn't hate the movie, but I was really disapointed.
Negative	"About as scary as a "" Facts of Life "" reunion special: The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
Negative	One terrible movie!: My girlfriend and I went to see The Haunting and almost walked out. I jumped once in the whole movie. It was slow, the acting was not very good. Do not waste your time with this one! I would have given this 0 stars but they did not have that option. BORED TO DEATH!
Positive	"One of the most scariest movies I have ever seen!: This movie has got to been one of the best horror movies I have seen in years. This movie made me so scared, when we saw it in the movie theater, I screamed out ""Oh, my god!"" at one scene of the movie! This movie is a thriller."
Negative	"Poopy!: Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
Positive	i liked Owen Wilsons part. IT was a suprising film that will: This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare.
Negative	"Things go ""DUD"" in the night: Once again a remake takes a ""Classic"" film ""The Haunting""(the best haunted house movie ever) and retooled it as an effects driven mess. Did they even watch the original or read the wonderful novel? Surely not if this is what they came up with. All the subtler aspects of the first are thrown out in favor of the mind numbing CGI effects. The result is one big dud of a ""thriller"". The cast is good but wasted as the makers seem more intent on showing us what they can do with CGI rather than giving us a true ""chiller"" like the better than ever original was.All in all, not even a nice try!!!"
Negative	WHY ?: Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot.
Negative	Not scary at all!: The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else.
Positive	The Haunting: I thought this was a great movie. Fine, so the story was average, but the fantastic effects and even better sound more than made up for it. I would recommend this film to anyone with a dolby digital setup, just sit back and feel the room shake!
Positive	"A True ""Thriller""!: While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its ""Thriller"" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old ""haunted house"". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park ""fun house"" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind."
Negative	"the real horror in this horror movie: When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another ""tech show""."
Negative	Slept like a baby...: I watched this flick at 1 a.m. Afterwards, I had no trouble falling asleep. When is Hollywood going to realize that showing too much emphasis on visuals makes bad theater? Overdone, bombastic,predictable,CGI effects. The house looked too much like a gaudy museum with ridiculous fixtures. On the positive side,though, the sound effects were great. The bass notes were very well done, subtle shades of ghostly children whispering and eerie creaky sounds throughout the house were the real jewel in this film.
Negative	A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative.
Negative	I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie: This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic.
Negative	"Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else: Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled ""The Haunting of Hill House""), Jan De Bont's brainless thriller ""The Haunting"" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the story and logic went. The film's razzle-dazzle visuals make it somewhat fun, but it's unescapably a downer."
Negative	ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER: THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
Positive	Pretty Good Flick: Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less.
Negative	"Ehhh , nice visuals?: I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
Negative	Ultimately, this one's a failure (though not without merit).: Four people are placed in a gigantic mansion as part of a study in fear, but they don't realize the house is actually haunted. Effects-heavy thriller features a decent beginning and a so-so cast (Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fine, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor are spectacularly awful), but eventually falls apart in the last half-hour, with a barrage of cheesy special effects taking over. Add to that the predictability and the sappy conclusion and you have a movie that went from promising to big dud. It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting).
Negative	Numbingly bad.: Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture.
Negative	One of the worst of 99...: Question: How do you take an excellent cast, millions of dollars, top of the line FX, base it on a good movie only toturn it into a piece of unwatchable garbage? Answer: Let Jan de Bont direct it.
Positive	Awesome Movie!: I went to a sneak preview of this movie when itcame out last July and I loved it! I read the book before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the book and the movie are not really that similiar. I loved this movie because I love haunting movies, scary stuff that makes the audience scream. This one does it, though at the end it is a little far fetched I have to admit, but overall I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting leaves something to be desired on many occasions, however, but a movie like this you don't go to see because of the acting. Four Out Of Five.
Negative	Bad horror movie: The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier.Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only acting poorly, she is also a complete misfit in this movie. It's as if she has just been asked to be in The Haunting because the makers want some chick on the screen. But you don't even see any of her sexiness in this movie.Furthermore, there are several ridiculous movie mistakes in The Haunting.There are a few relatively scary scenes and even some good laughs here and there. Apart from that, only Lily Taylor's acting is worth mentioning.
Negative	Writer and director witoout souls: I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
Negative	Wow, What a Disappointment: It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this.
Positive	Great Movie: I seen this movie too many times to get scared. But I enjoy it each time. I also enjoy watching the special features. The house that they filmed this movie in was really haunted. The movie crew kept seeing, feeling, and hearing things. They also talked about different haunted places in the special features. If you are into haunted movie's you don't want to pass this movie up.
Negative	Promises alot. Delivers little.: I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down.
Negative	Microwaved horror: Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother.
Negative	"Unbelievably Putrid: Stay away from this putrid piece of decaying mouse droppings! This is just another fine example of taking a large budget film and creating various computer generated images which look ""COOL"" and write some dialogue and a very weak story line around it. When will people stop being oohed and awed by special effects and appreciate writing content of a movie? The old Julie Harris movie is so superior, see it! You will see what a good movie is! Why remake some a classic with some screenwriter first credit for a movie. I feel the writer rented 20 horror movies, sat and watched them and took notes. ""Hey I like that and that."" If this film comes anywhere near you, use a crucifix or holy water, anything to save 2 hours of your life!"
Negative	"NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE.: This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
Negative	CGI no substitute for story: This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Might have worked as an original idea, but being a re-make of a classic movie, itself based on a classic novel, necessitates living up to the original, which this movie did not.
Negative	Just skip it.: 1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time.
Positive	"Entertaining and Effective: I understand that this was based on the classic book by Shirley Jackson's "" The Haunting of Hill House"" which is an excellent book. May I suggest that those who love ghost stories read Shirley's Book. The original Movie titled ""The Haunting"" that was released in the early '60's, stared Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It was done in black and white and was very effective for it's time in moving it's audience. I highly recommend seeing this version also. Now, this new updated version has hit the screen with great effects, great scenery and vivid color for the modern era. Yes, it to stands alone and is very effective for it's time. I don't feel any of the three medias should be compared. They all stand alone on their own and all should be enjoyed. So I highly recommend that if one enjoys chills up one's spine, they should go out and rent or buy all three versions and enjoy one wonderful experience after another."
Positive	Two Thumbs Up: I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.
Negative	Not Oscar Material: Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those.
Negative	"This movie insulted my intelligence...: along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
Positive	GREAT MOVIE: THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME ALOT OF THE ACTORS ARE YOUNG, I LOVED THE EFFECTS, FOR A OLDER MOVIE IT HAD SOME AWESOME UPGRADES. I AM SO GLAD I OWN IT.
Negative	Truly disappointing: This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful.
Negative	"Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive ""b"" movie??: OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT remake great movies if you cannot do any even better job of telling the story! Its a waste and an annoyance!"
Negative	Watch the original instead: Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier.
Negative	Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost movies about them): Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here. This movie was the pits.
Negative	"Must I even give it one star?: Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
Negative	THE HAUNTING: ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW. THE NEW DEPENDS ON COMPUTER EFFECTS. WHICH WERE PRETTY COOL. BUT DID NOT SAVE THE MOVIE FROM ITS DOWNFALL. ITS LACK OF STORY WAS LAME.NOT SCARY WHAT SO EVER. SEE THE ORIGINAL. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
Negative	"The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones: I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."
Negative	The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through...: It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie.
Negative	This is not a horror movie.: This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense.
Negative	Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch: I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald's for the rest of their lives. This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video. If you want to see a classic haunted house story and be scared, then get the original movie with Claire Bloom.
Positive	A funhouse of special effects.: This DVD has superior picture than the video version. Its a good film of effects and the audio is far superior on DVD. I thought it sounded smooth and clear and dialog is easily heard. Hugh Crane haunted the house with spookier sounds that were unnoticed on video or in most theaters. I love films, but I am not that picky on the tech spects, but if you want to own this film, get DVD. It rules, and its easy to use for anyone who likes movies.
Positive	A Children Horror Movie: It's a pretty good movie ! It's more a kids movie, a kids horror movie, those children who Eleanor must save. My 9 year old sister watched it either and she likes the movie either. The ending whas a little weak but overall it's great. Rating: 8,5 of 10
Positive	"Welcome Home Eleanor: Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)went to the haunted ""Hill House"" together with three other People, included Eleanor (Lilly Taylor), a bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). Everything seemes harmless... at the beginning of course. But it isn't! Strange things happening to the Guests of the ""Hill House""! Children are talking to them, Statues are moving and bloody footprint are leading them to mysterious places! All this is happening most of all to Eleanor. She is seeing things. Things that nobody else cans see...This is a hillerious Ghost-Story with breathtaking Special Effects and a just perfect ""Hill House""!!!Buy this DVD but beware: ""Everyone lives in Town three Miles away from here. Everyone leaves before Dark. Nobody will come any nearer than that, in the night, in the dark..."""
Negative	Expected More: I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you.
Negative	The Haunting is just... bad.: If you want a good haunted house flick, get something else... anything else. This film has a pretty set, but no character development, no suspense, no scares, and no point.
Negative	"Two hours I'll never get back!: When I heard they were remaking ""The Haunting,"" I was excited. I love the original movie. I thought that with the modern techniques we have, we could make a good movie better.I was wrong. Sitting through this stinker was torture. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that's similar to Shirley Jackson's novel and the original movie is the name. Want to do something fun? Go get a root canal. It would be a lot more fun than this movie."
Negative	Worst movie I've ever seen: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the classic 1963 version. Not to mention the worst ending I have ever seen. The only things this movie has going for it are the special effects and the house itself even though the house in the 1963 version looked a lot scarier and more sufficating, like it was truely alive. If you get any movie get the original The Haunting.
Negative	"Really boring: This is probably the worst ""horror"" movie I have ever seen! Don't see this unless you want to be bored to death!"
Negative	Boring, not scary: This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it.
Negative	"It had a lot of potential: If this movie had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. ""I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine! Go to hell!"""
Negative	"good special effects, but no plot: To think of the courage it took hollywood to actualy claim that this was taken from Jackson's book ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is amazing. I am a big fan of the book and I'm just writing to tell that there is little simularity's between the movie and the book. Only the names are the same and 1 five minute scene is taken from the book. The rest is from the imagination of the screenwriter. I would think that if you are going to change that much of a plot, then you shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as from the book. However, the special effects are amazing, the acting is well done. They should have put another title to it and changed the names of the charecters. Then it could have been there own work. Very disapointing."
Negative	Good special effects, lame otherwise: The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)
Negative	"Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."
Negative	INSOMNIA CURE! WATCH THIS MOVIE!: THE MOVIE TAKES SO LONG TO GET INTERESTING YOUR ASLEEP BEFOREYOU KNOW IT.THANK GOD I RENTED THIS!
Negative	Too Long To Get To The Point: This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
Negative	OH MY GOD: Though I have a suspicion that this movie will soon become a cult favorite, currently, it is simply one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror movies ever made. The elements -- including the cast, from a pouting, bi-sexual Catherine Zeta-Jones to an achingly sincere Lillian Taylor, and the plot, which takes a classic Shirley Jackson story and actually takes away the terror -- are each so bad that the end result is one of those movies you watch and say -- how did this ever get made? Redeeming qualities: the set, which is so massive and full of detail that it is interesting to explore, and a few of the special effects, which unfortunately do not help you to understand the absurdly diluted-and-then-regurgitated plot. There could have been a great horror movie from that story, but this is definitely not it.
Negative	Just terrible: No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period.
Negative	Absolutely horrible: Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store.
Positive	"This is a must see for anyone who likes haunted houses.: This is one movie I would watch over and over again. The story is great. the suspense is great without alot of blood and guts. As it says in the movie"" makes a great bedtime story""."
Negative	Huge talents in a poor poor movie: Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie.
Negative	I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back: If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?
Negative	Very sorry indeed.: Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money...
Negative	Typical Hollywood Bull Sh*t: What you would expect from a hollywood production. If you LOVE Hollywood, you'll LOVE this, otherwise go check out something that is actually freaky, I.E. The Changling or Suspiria.
Negative	Please don't even bother with this one: I saw the original movie made in 1963 and it was wonderful. I was very anxious for this remake to come out and man was I disappointed!! It was horrible!
Negative	Dismal: I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece.
Negative	About as scary as The Simpsons!: I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!
Negative	what a joke: this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?
Negative	TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING: It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!
Negative	Don't waste your time, money, energy on this stinker!: I didn't realize this movie was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!
Negative	Try something else.: I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there.
Negative	"Not for Shirley Jackson fans: This remake supposedly is based on ""The Haunting of Hill House"" by Shirley Jackson, but there is actually very little of her original novel in this version. In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it's an insult to say it's based on her work.The first film from the 1960's is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it's so scary.In this new ""version,"" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh! And the way it ends is just totally not right! Read the book! See the first version on film! Avoid this new one like the plague.(It's telling -- as of the today, the DVD of the remake is selling for less than the DVD of the first film!)"
Negative	This movie stinks!: This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!
Negative	Disgrace: Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see.
Negative	this movie sucks!: This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame.
Positive	Creepy: Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film.....however I must admit that the atmosphere of the orginal has been reproduced by some great effect and some superb camera work. The actors perform quite well, however they do tend to play second fiddle to the effects - and more importantly the house itself (which is breath-taking). As the film progresses the feeling of dread builds to a good climax, which is slighly more upbeat than that of the original! Nevertheless this film does not deserve the slagging it got in the press and does well to keep up with the black & white version.
Positive	"Not that bad after all: Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
Negative	ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE: How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made. Get the original 1963 version or read the classic novel--BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE!
Negative	Hollywood has run out of ideas......: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!
Negative	"The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted: a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
Negative	"A waste of time and money: Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
Negative	Worst Movie Ever Made: If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along. Very little care was paid to the story when bringing this film to the screen. The only care seems to have been for the special effects. I want my two hours back.
Negative	"TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR: ""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
Negative	"Got Carried Away with Special Effects: I thought this movie was really cheesy. It got so carried away with the special effects, that there wasn't enough room for a real story. This new version of ""The Haunting"" was terrible, and it could have been a whole lot better. I don't reccomend this film to anyone who has seen the original, they would be very dissapointed and frustrated."
Negative	Go Haunt Yourself!: This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10.
Negative	"99.9 FAILURE!: The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
Negative	Some movies are just born bad...: To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told.
Negative	"Terrible...!: Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch ""The House On Haunted Hill"" (1999) or ""Thir13een Ghosts"" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"
Negative	Worst Film Ever Made, ever!: It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!
Negative	Read the Book: What made the book horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters.The ending was completely destroyed. The writers/director/producer should have stuck closer to the original story and this would have been a much better movie: a classic.C'est la vie.
Negative	"A very poorly done horror movie.: A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
Negative	Big Thumb's Down!: Lousy, poorly adapted film that takes an excellent book and tacks on the lamest, un-scariest, unneeded Hollywood ending. Why? Just so it could have a happy ending. Terrible! Terible!
Negative	Come on!: This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible.
Negative	"Boredom personified!: This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
Positive	Terrific!: This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. This flick was truly watchable and enjoyable. It will have you glued to your screen! If you love scary movies, don't pass up this one!
Positive	I like it.: I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie.
Negative	Terrible: To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
Negative	Wish I could give it 0 stars: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks.
Negative	Worst possible remake: I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house.
Negative	A waste of valuable money!: I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price.
Negative	Tell me a story: This film suffers greatly from having nothing at all to say. The set was grand, but the script was lacking and the actors had nothing to do but make it through to their paychecks. Don't waste your time.
Negative	Mediocre horror movie: I guess the special effects were OK.... Frankly, however, this was kinda a big disappointment - with fine actors like Neeson and Zeta-Jones you'd expect more. Rather give this one a skip and go watch the 'Scream' movies all over again.....
Negative	not bad!: My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this movie but you might find it boring a bit.I dont recommend this to people who enjoy movies that have a good story and directing.
Negative	okay movie with a couple scary parts: You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this.
Negative	"Please!: This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
Negative	"poor remake: Whoever made this misunderstood the word `scary', special effects make you go ""wow"" not ""aarrgghh! ""Look to the original version."
Negative	A BAD VERSION OF THE HAUNTING!!!: This was a bad remake of a really original SCARY movie. This remake focuses on the children trapped in the house. The original movie focused on the house and how scary and evil it was. That was what made it scary. The Haunting remake has ok special effects but some were not needed. Whoever reads this review I don't really recommend this movie but if you want to waste a couple of bucks go ahead.
Negative	there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty.
Negative	skip the movie: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello.
Negative	"AWFUL!: I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
Negative	Sue me: I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?
Positive	"Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!: The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
Negative	What unmitigated....: CRAP!The original Haunting from 1963 has long long been my favourite ghost story....So I was excited tho needless very apprehensive about this remake. Somehow I knew modern Hollywood would mess it completely up. And they did not disappoint me.Completely changed the whole background and story line. Instead of the subtle and eerie horror...you get the gore and obvious.Don't waste any time on this junk. Of course if you are like the majority of clueless americans...this might be right up your alley.
Negative	Not frightening, not anything: There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student.
Positive	The Haunting: Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film.
Negative	there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat.

Negative	Oh no,: It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either.
Negative	horribly......stupid: Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing.
Positive	Extremely interesting and exciting! A real QUEST!: Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action. It is not an ordinary scary movie or thriller - definitely, it is more... Try it and I think you won't be disappointed at all.
Positive	"One of the best ""Haunted House"" movies I've ever seen!!: I bought this movie after hearing how creepy it was. I was very surprised how good this movie really was. I really liked the parts with the children calling Elanore to help save them. I am very happy with this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the hottest actor I've ever seen star in a horror movie! This DVD is well worth your movie!:)"
Positive	WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe.
Positive	"Best Haunted House CGI I've Seen So Far: I like haunted house movies and this film is no exception. Yes, it is a ""reimaging"" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I'm also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort."
Negative	in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts: there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original
Negative	Horrible: And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost story and tried to do something with it.The problem is that they relied way way way too heavily on special effects. Don't believe me? Watch the original. It will have your skin crawling and had very little special effects.Why do they have to try to rework something that is perfect? I don't get it.If Hollywood is going to rework a masterpiece, then play it straight. Just because you can do all sorts of things with special effects doesn't mean you have to try to put them in remakes, especially if the original is perfect!
Positive	"Pretty scary-not so swift ending: I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
Negative	"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL: To say that this version of ""The Haunting"" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."
Negative	"ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM: Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"
Positive	"Terrific apologetics novel explains Catholicism from Bible: I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the ""Roman"" church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"
Positive	"A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith: The book ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. And oh, how this is needed in these times of crisis and confusion in church catechesis. A must read for every Catholic of all ages, religious and clergy included, and a great book to share."
Positive	Dan's Review: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars.
Positive	Lasalle student's book review: I enjoyed this book very much, to my suprise. When my teacher assigned this book, I thought that I would be bored throughout of the whole book. I did not think that i would be to interested in a book about church and Fundamentalism, but as I got into the book I really started to enjoy it. I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better. All of the information about Catholic religion and why mary and peter are respected in the church. This book gave me a great experience in learning things about my Catholic faith that i never thought i would learn. I am glad my teacher gave me this assignment.
Positive	Stephen Dwyer: A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.
Positive	"Review For Mr. Puntel: Having read ""A Philadelphia Catholic In King James' Court"" I received a better picture of the Catholic Church. I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."
Positive	"An online review!: This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the ""conflict"" that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the ""questioning"" and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."
Negative	APCIKJC by White: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected.
Negative	Untitled: This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written.
Negative	PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam: This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book.
Positive	Religion Review - LSCHS Student: After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass.
Positive	Mr. Puntels Class: The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it.
Positive	The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views: Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story.
Positive	Erik Haney Book Reveiw: I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a very good book. It was very well written and had a good plot. It is the first ever apologetic novel, and it has done a good job in clearing the way for others. In this book, there were many good discussions on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. My favorite parts in the book were whenever, Michael was in the Bible study sessions, and these chapters were very exciting. In the book, there were many good characters that really helped to make this book a lot more interesting for the reader. I especially liked that Michael succeeded in bible study and convinced hid cousin Eli, through his teachings and discussions of the Catholic Church. I thought that the story was well written, and I would love to read a sequel.
Positive	Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars.
Negative	"Misleading entities...: While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."
Positive	"A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish: Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
Positive	"Urban Bushmen: The Art Ensemble in top form: Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. The AEC's trademark percussion ensembles, jocular takes on marching music, etc., are surrounded by inspired playing. ""New York is full of lonely people"" is one of Lester Bowie's most enduring and beautiful melodies. Long enough to allow the group to do its characteristic stretching of time on long improvs, this is still, in my view, an accessible record. A great place to start exploring the music of the full quintet version of the band, along with their other ECM albums, and a pair of their live sets from early 70's."
Negative	Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0: This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information.
Negative	Not very useful: As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book).
Negative	sound quality ??????: the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
Positive	Looks good, but not for mobile applications.: I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car. It is small, rugged, and runs on 12 volts. I contacted RF Link and they even sent me a unit to try out, along with their amplifier, so that definitely says good things about them. Unfortunately, it did not work at all for me. As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around.
Negative	Not as advertised: The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
Negative	zero customer service: I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase.
Negative	"Unfortunate Waste of Money: It's a great concept.... connecting A/V devices over a short distance without wires. However, the Rf Link system doesn't quite make it a reality. I tried very hard to use the system to connect a camcorder to a TV/monitor. Even at a very short distance of 10 feet, the signal continously drops. I even tried adding the ""optional"" Rf Link output booster. However, any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver (still at 10 feet) causes the signal to drop out.... totally unacceptable and unusable. The only happy note was Amazon's great customer service and return policy."
Positive	Ralph does it again!!: My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!
Positive	"Soon to be your kid's favorite: As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
Negative	I'd like to see Ralph at the bottom of the sea: Covert writes a bunch of non-sensical, sophomoric songs that my kids simply hate. This guy is a Barney-wannabe and this album does nothing to save his dignity.
Positive	"ten stars wouldn't be enough!: What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Well-crafted songs with clever lyrics and talented musicianship make for a 50-minute delight. ""At the Bottom of the Sea"" has clever word-play, ""Surfin' in My Imagination"" has some fine surf guitar and inspires some uninhibited dancing, and a great rendition of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" should have you singing in no time with your child. Each song is worth hearing over and over (and over), and this CD is money well spent. My son laughs and laughs at Eighteen Wheels on a Big Rig,"" and I am partial to and extremely appreciative of ""The Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song)."" After all, four bananas make a bunch and so do many more!I am incredibly impressed with Ralph Covert's abilities to reach a child's imagination without shutting out the adults. I am going to buy this as a gift to all parents I know, and I also plan to purchase Ralph's World's first CD. This CD should be at the top of anyone's Wish List."
Positive	Kelly Jumped Into Our Family!: My daughter is 3 and she loves all of the Barbie items but they are still sometimes too big and hard for her to play with. I finally convinced her to try out Barbie's sister Kelly with this Jumpin Castle playset and she loves it. The playset was not hard to put together - it only took me about 5 minutes. The only thing that did not impress me with the toy is the cardboard cutouts in the box that you fold up to be presents for Kelly. We just tossed those but the toy itself is great and is teaching my daughter how to pretend play.
Positive	Fun for a while...: We bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday & she really loved it at first. She especially liked it when her older cousin showed her that she could put other small toys in the castle & pop them out and across the room. However, she lost interest soon after & I haven't seen her play with it in the 3 months since her birthday.
Negative	like the doll, but that's it: Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and, in the long run, my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll, I wouldn't recommend this one, just a waste of plastic here.
Positive	cabin-worthy: Live in New Mexico and have a summer mountain cabin at 8500 ft in Cloudcroft--brrr. Usually 15-20 at night in January. No other heat source. Got the new Dyna-Glo 23,000 BTU Portable Kerosene Convection Heater up there yesterday at 130 PM and it was 30F in the cabin. it has a 400 sq ft main room and a 280 sq ft upper sleeping quarters. Temp went up to 40 in 1 hr; 50 in 2hrs; and it was 65 in 4 hrs. It was 72 degrees at bedtime, 1030PM, and I filled the tank and went upstairs where it was 58 degrees. Put a CO monitor at the stairwell to go off so I wouldnt die of CO poisoning in my sleep. It never went off. By morning, it was 61 upstairs, and 80 in the main room. The full tank had gone down by just over 1/2 by 7AM. No stink at all and I am sensitive to that. Had to shut it off to cool it down in there for morning coffee! The low outdoor temp only got to 28F, so not sure how it would do in lower temps....will update if/when we try it. GOOD heater, albeit a little slow to get there.
Positive	Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain.
Positive	Doolittle is Doing a LOT!: First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother? Because Jerome Doolittle's Body Scissor's is worth the read and the write. If you enjoy Crais, Parker et al, you will enjoy Jerome's style as well. Tom Bethany is just the guy I'd like to be--if I were a guy. :-) Read his earlier works- grow with his characters.
Negative	First Part: I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update.
Negative	"This book make my feel bad for a moment and some tests in end have suggestions for buy more book from same publisher: As I see that, book have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of book, only comments like something as ""If you not understand it now, after all what you read, you need buy ""Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies... etc""- what really agressive advertising, make peoples feel scared, stupid and affraid and make them need buy more books from this publisher...Its scare my for a moment!Most helpful for my Peterson ASVAB, what have good explanation for ALL tests. I never not bui something ""for dummies"" again."
Negative	not what people think: this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned. Im sure there are better ways to improve your math skills. don't waste your money.
Positive	asvab for dummies: great book..i have learned a lot!! i recommend this book for anyone who wants to join the military and will soon be faced with taking the ASVAB test.i studied for the math section of the ASVAB and i passed with flying colors
Positive	Good item, but could it be better: The book is very easy to read and understand, gives very clear explanations, but it could it be great if it included a practice CD like most ASVAB books now come with...
Positive	Excellent resource: I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information.
Positive	Very Helpful: This book was very helpful in letting us know about the ASVAB. It showed us how to get a better AFQT score as well as what areas we needed to score higher in to get the job we wanted. It was very easy to use and the practice tests were so helpful. My husband past the test and got the job area he wanted. It also prepared him for what the test day was like and gave him clues on how to stay at ease and help his knowledge be better used. We were in a hurry to study up and it was quick and to the point. I will probably look at other dummies books for other helps.
Positive	If you want a higher ASVAB score get this book!: I am currently DEPed into the US Navy.Before taking the ASVAB, I took several online practice exams, as well as the first practice exam inside this book. I didn't do too well on certain portions of the exam.Focusing on the things I had trouble on, and brushing up on the rest of the stuff, I studied for about a month.When I went to take my ASVAB for the first time, I did well on every exam, making a 94 AFQT (scored higher than 94% of applicants).I absolutely recommend this book. It provides more knowledge than is needed to pass the test, and keeps things interesting with side-notes, trivia, and funny comments.
Positive	Good book lots of info: It really is a great book it is full of facts. It helps you solve problems and gives you hints for taking the test, most recruiters recommend this, it is also cheaper on here then that garbage store Barns and Noble.
Negative	Missing pages.: Contents references pages up to 375. Book stop at page 342. Three chapters are missing. Good book up until the missing chapters.
Negative	Asvab for Dummies: It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
Negative	yes and no: I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying.
Positive	Getting Ready: It arrived in perfect condition and when they said so. Got this for my son, who wants to go into the Marines. He said, it has helped him with the Math since it breaks it down into layman terms and helped him understand the algebra section which he struggles with. So happy they have a book that focused on the test for military. This should give him a leg up on a good score on the test. God bless all our young men and women who give their all for our freedom.
Positive	great book: i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best
Positive	Was a gift: The book arrived in great shape and on time. It was a gift, so I'm not sure of anything else related to the contents of the book, or if it was helpful to the person who received it as a gift.
Positive	easy transaction!: great transaction.. book is as described and was received on time.. at the given price this was a good value!
Positive	easy to get through!!!: I'm almost looking forward to actually taking the ASVAB after reading through this book- it made everything so easy, even the sections I don't need to excel in! Very clear, and the author is personable enough to make you feel comfortable while learning...
Positive	Great book, very complete!: My husband said this book was excellent, its really helping him study for the ASVAB, he hasnt taken it yet so we dont know what his score will be but he studies everyday using this book.
Negative	"Few Errors: If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
Positive	Great book: This book was wonderful. My son needed it to improve his ASVAB score and it worked really well for us. He did score higher, a lot higher than his orginal score and we were both please with the results. I would recommend this to anyone attempting to take the ASVAB. You will reap the benefits if you read and study the book.
Positive	Great study guide!!!: I studied my butt off with the help of this book. The practice tests in this book were actually harder than the real ASVAB! That helped me be even more prepared. I only missed 5 questions on the ASVAB! NO LIE! Study this book for about 3 weeks and take it seriously. You will see your scores improve!!!
Negative	incorrect practice test answers: I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back.
Positive	A wonderful help for those interested in the military: This is one of the easiest to follow books on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.
Positive	Good: Teaches you really good and easy to understand and allows you to learn the asvab with no problem in order to pass with flying colors
Positive	Amazing book.: This book will help my granddaughter pass the exam for entering the navy. Anyone who wants to enter any branch of the service needs this book to study.
Positive	LOVE IT!: I Love this book it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . It's not boring either . I love how it describes everything! Definitely a book to get to study for your ASVAB!
Positive	already useful: my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this book really helpful on what to study. the preview tests are great mind joggers.
Negative	FULL OF MISTAKES!!!!: This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher.
Negative	Inadequate: The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can't hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections. It's obvious on many test sections that the answer is for a different question. Plus, the questions are way too easy--like training with matchsticks when you're going to have to move tree trunks.
Negative	LOTS OF ERRORS!!!: This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
Positive	"Almost perfect: I needed vents for my observation hive. I would have preferred something a bit smaller made of brass, but this is the best I could find. Keeping my fingers crossed, I ordered these up. After assembly of the hive, I found that they actually look pretty good and they do provide the ventilation required for the hive. The louver spacing is also small enough to prevent unintended escapes. A 1"" wood auger makes a hole perfect for proper fit. They are well made and the price is right."
Positive	great early nick cave: boys next door is a very early incantation of nick cave.pulsating group of song from a master and Shivers is one of the finest songs cave has ever written
Positive	"Interesting, fun and enjoyable.: I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
Negative	aim low: Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests.
Negative	"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM or FROM ADAM HERSH: They never sent me one of the items I purchased. I am still waiting for it. Now I just noticed that one of the items I bought from them that was supposed to be 16 x 20"" is much smaller.It has been more than a month after purchasing from them already.BEWARE ADAM HERSH"
Positive	Very helpful: This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.
Positive	You're Late Again Lord...: I really enjoyed this book. The author was refreshingly frank and backed up her points with scripture. I would highly recommend this book.
Positive	"Right On !: This book is a terrific read! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. Karon Goodman is right on with her sense of humor and advice on how to spend your time while in God's ""waiting room"". Patience is not a strong point for me and I'll be darned if Goodman didn't describe me to a ""T"" while speaking of herself! Definitely a must read for those Thomas' out there!!"
Positive	"This book was me to the core!: I can't express the gratitude I feel toward Karon, for expressing exactly how I've felt about going through ""the wait"" for so long. She hits the nail on the head with every single paragraph of this book. How does she do that? I found myself wanting to read it over and over, and truly contemplating the questions at the end of each chapter. Amazingly, the same answers kept coming up for me, so I truly got clear on what I had to do. Thank you, Karon, and thank you Lord for using her to help me! A MUST HAVE!!!"
Positive	Does the job well! Just needs 1 tweak.: I'm not sure how much I can say about a meat tenderizer... it either does the job or it doesn't, and this one does, regardless of the meat. We've tried it on chicken and ribeyes thus far - it allowed the marinade that we use on ribeyes to permeate much better than before, which cuts down on time and makes a better steak! On the chicken, it easily turned standard grocery store chicken breast into restaurant quality tenderness.The handle is great, it's nice & comfy. The shape of the handle overall is ergonomically friendly.The tweak it needs: there are 4 disks in all, and all are stored in the head. The problem is that you MUST store the 3 that aren't in use in the head in order to hold the one disk you're using in place, effectively meaning that all must be washed, even though you're only using one. The benefit to this approach, on the flip side, is that you're less likely to lose a disk.
Positive	Excellent tempo: I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. I would rate if 5 stars if it had any headstand prep work.
Positive	love it: I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)
Negative	"Say what??!!: Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
Negative	not very exciting: I bought this video based on the other reviews on this websiteand I do not agree with the others. This video is boring, dull,repetitive, monotonous and unimaginative. Between each sunsalute there are stretches. These stretches repeat cumulatively! This combined with the repetitions of thesun salutes make for too much repetition.
Negative	Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser: I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace
Positive	Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.: As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great.
Positive	"Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (""A Year in Provence,"" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his ""diary"" makes for a good read and a good history lesson."
Positive	"Eternal City: The word ""journal"" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."
Positive	"Babies LOVE this book!: We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
Positive	This is my baby's favorite book!!: I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day. She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago. She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes. This is her favorite toy.
Positive	"Can't go wrong w/ an old fashion cross track: We have one of these, and while we're not always able to work it into our layout on the train table, it's definitely been in some of our favorite configurations. Plus, it provides for that all important ""train crash"" action when two engines are trying to cross at the same time!"
Negative	ADS Instant Video: You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient.
Positive	Not a Hollywood Expose: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private.
Positive	More Mrs. Heelis than Beatrix Potter: This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author. I enjoy family histories so I found it to be an interesting little book but if you're looking for a straight biography this may disappoint.
Positive	Good replacement part: This was a good replacement brake pedal pad for my 98' Toyota Tacoma.A little tough to get on but it does need to fit tight and does after you get it on.Thanks AMAZON for having parts like this.
Negative	Bummed: This pedal was for a standard tranny - much to small for my automatic transmission brake pedal.I must of misread the description or something. Not inclined to go back and reread the description.
Positive	Been Reviewed!: In my last review I said this book makes for edgy, fascinating reading! It is hard to put this book down! I also read this book as a senior in high school, between ages 17 and 18 years of age!
Positive	"Definately worth knowing: I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read ""Diary of a Madman"", ""The Nose"", and ""The Overcoat"". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."
Positive	Oddity of the Crazed: A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over.
Positive	"Great Story!: If you have ever lived in a small rural town you will certainly be able to relate to and appreciate Jack Polidoro's latest novel, RETURN TO RABY. If you have not had this living experience, Polidoro's novel will enlighten you as to just what you have been missing! Polidoro's novel is based on the reality of a small New Hampshire town that comes alive page after page and truly shows how rural life can be. Having lived in a ""Raby""like town myself, I could relate to the story first hand. I passed the book on to friends who have never been out of the city and the book was equally enjoyable to them! This story will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. You will be left will a warm feeling and a positive outlook on life. This is truly a wonderful story!"
Negative	"A poster? Really?: This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
Negative	"a fine freshman composition text that costs too much: It is sad that this book--and the comprable ""Short Prose Reader"" from McGraw-Hill--are seriously compromised by the greed of a publisher that prices a book in its 8th edition that could be marketed profitably for less than ten dollars and prices it out of the range of poor students."
Negative	Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.
Negative	hummm: A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!
Negative	"Nope, nope: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
Negative	Only use if original pins are broken.: I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik
Positive	Dorman 38437 Door Hinge Repair Kit: This Kit did work , but if I was to do it again i would go for the kit with threaded studs
Positive	Young man crazy about this book: Looking at this collection really shows the diversity in Hokusai's long career. In one of the essays, the writter comments that Hokusai changes his style so much that his work looks like the work of a different artist. The breath of this volume helps the viewer see how creative and inventive this master is. What I like about Hokusai is that his personal life is just as interesting as his work. The essays included do a good job placing the differnent periods in context with the times and Hokusai's own massive body of work.
Positive	Lovely: I saw Beth Waters perform at Slims in San Francisco. I was not planning on getting there early enough to see her. I am so glad I did. I bought three copies of her CD, and hope to see and hear LOTS more from her! She opens her mouth, and out comes this beautiful, rich voice. She is young, and I think will grow as a singer and performer, but... trust me, this is a CD worth owning.
Negative	Not good quality: This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?
Negative	Do Not Buy: I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
Positive	Gyroscope: The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.
Negative	zero durability: the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all.
Negative	"Rather plain: Disappointed by this item. I bought a couple of ""crystal"" decanters at the same time, which cost only a few dollars more. The difference was striking. This set is very dull, ordinary glass, and the rubber stopper in the decanter looks cheap."
Positive	"Best Thing Ever Created!: My 3 year old is in LOVE with paint and this makes the whole idea of ""Painting"" more bearable for me. Instead of cleaning up paint messes on the carpet, on her and on the walls - I can sit her down on the sidewalk with this and she can paint away on everything (including the trees) to her heart's content. Wish they offered more colors, but being able to teach her that Blue+Yellow=Green is also a bonus."
Negative	doesn't wash off that easily: We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.
Negative	Not how I thought it would be: The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight.
Positive	A very good read: Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed.
Positive	Wonderful: We had to watch this in French class and I thought it would be a really boring movie, but it wasn't. This is a wonderful movie for students studying french and anyone who likes the language. Jean de Florette is the movie before this one and it is also awesome.
Positive	an absolutely breathtaking score - captured my imagination!: just.....mmmmm....stunning....i listen to it when i want to BE french, to be in love and feel my heart break, to transport myself somewhere else in time. gorgoise!!!!
Positive	Jean de Florette et Manon des sources: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources en dvd. merci a vous.attend une réponse de vous.
Positive	"The final chapter of Jean de Florette: Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
Positive	"a fabulous sequel: As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed."
Positive	"great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, ""Jean de Florette"", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!"
Negative	Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: A note of caution regarding this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import dvd under any circumstances. In an act of artistic mutilation, the pivotal and brief, chaste yet joyful nude dance scene featuring Manon is prudishly obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (though we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it. BTW, my rating applies only to the Korean import, other versions (dvd or vhs) get five stars.
Negative	Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: I have only one thing to say about this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import version under any circumstances. In this version, the pivotal, brief and completely chaste nude dance scene featuring Manon is obscured. Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (but we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it.
Positive	Good performances: I bought this CD because it's one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. The sound quality is good, and the guitar tone is good as well. I thought the tempos of the Suite were a little fast, but otherwise, a nice CD reference of Tansman's work.
Positive	A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters: I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable.
Negative	"Won't work in Dimage 7i: Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
Negative	Wouldn't recommended: This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). I reformatted the disk few times and I'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera. Since it has a life time warranty on it, I'm RMA it back to SimpleTech.
Positive	Great Product, Wonderful Price: I got this at an excellent sale price, and I have never regretted it. I haven't had a single problem with the card, and I didn't have to reformat it for it to work with my Canon A40.
Negative	Too much money for a medicore card: The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company.
Negative	"Speed IS actually an issue!: I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys?! My card didn't lock anything up, but it wasn't as responsive as two other brands that I currently use (I won't name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate). I do believe that I won't try them again until I hit upon their ""good"" cards though."
Negative	It's dead on the first day!: I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500. I tried it by taking a couple of pictures. Suddenly, the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error. :( That was only 10 minutes of using it. Then I tried it with a Canon G2...still did not work...had to return it...
Negative	"Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!: Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card, started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error, and acted upon the recommendation to format the card. After reformatting the SimpleTech card, still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos. I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon's wonderful return policy. I really do love this e-tailer!My ""meager"" Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine...."
Negative	Compatibility issues - Be careful!: ...I bought this card thinking I could install it in my FujiFilm FinePix S2Pro and have no problems, but I got errors that could not be cleared by in-camera or Windows formatting of the media.I have never had a problem with CompactFlash before, and of the half dozen manufacturers I have, including Lexar, Sandisk, Nikon-branded, Fuji-branded and some Brand-x I picked up at Frys, all of them work in my S2Pro, whereas only one of the SimpleTech cards will.Better safe than sorry!
Negative	"Is NOT compatible with Minolta DiMage 7i: I purchased the 256 mb compactflash card to increase the number of photos I could take, however after inserting it into my Minolta Dimage 7i, it gives a message of ""Unable to use card"". I emailed Amazon with the results of my problem, and also asked if others had the same problem (they did not state there was any problem)and they promptly sent me another thinking I only had a bad compactflash. The SECOND one also gives the same message. I will be returning both. I have purchased another brand somewhere else and it works fine. So,If you own the Minolta Dimage 7i - save yourself some time and headaches in returning it - THIS WILL NOT WORK!"
Negative	"It does not work with Minolta 7i: It works with SimpleTech STI-UCF100 Reader,but not with Minolta 7i. It says ""Unable to use card"".Formating does not help."
Negative	I'm afraid it sucks.: I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky.
Positive	a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.
Positive	It keeps working!: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.
Positive	Very fast!!: Simpletech's 256MB CF is very fast. I use it with my Canon camera and love it. It gives me quick transfer rates with high resolution. Same time and money and any headaches.
Negative	defective: After 6 months of very light use, this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip, taking 100 or so important shots with it. Cannot afford to use this kind of quality again.
Negative	Crapped out on me.: Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for.
Negative	Not for use with Canon Powershot: It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously.
Positive	Check out the SPEED! From a Digital Guru.: I've read many reviews about Compact Flash card speed and a couple of them here on Amazon. I read one review that listed some very high speeds for other brands, above 8000 kb/s. I don't know where that data came from, but in independant photo review sites, this SimpleTech card screams. No other brand was faster. By the way, no brand has ever tested in Camera's that even came close to 8000 kb/s or above.Most CF cards test in at around 2000 Kb/s, some well known brands(SanDisk and Lexar) are at 800kb/s not 8000!!!! If you really want the truth, no card does well in Nikon's. They read at one bit, other cameras,Canon, Minolta etc read with 4 bits, are more advanced and produce superior results with both read and write speeds. The more advanced Camera's do make a difference. Check out independant reviews first, before you buy a camera or a card for your camera.
Negative	CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews: After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble.
Negative	"Too slow? Fast enough? Unreliable is more like it!: After reading some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. I purchased two and put them to the test. I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader. For reasons I can't explain, the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up. To double check if it was something else, I reproduced the problem 3 more times. I didn't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar, no prob!! So on to the second card. Guess what, no freezes, but the folks in the ""it's a slow card"" camp are right! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows? I just know I don't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches. Mine were returned. Good luck, though....."
Positive	What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor.
Positive	A wonderful discovery: Martínez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalbá evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure.
Negative	Dragon Fire: I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
Negative	basic grammer: This book contained some useful information on the basic grammer of the english language, but was mediocore (at best) compared to the Yarber's previous book (reviewing basic grammer, also available on amazon.com)
Negative	oh shut up!: I found this book so over the top it was absurd. In one chapter it actually states that most people who try pot don't feel any difference at all and wonder what all the fuss is about. Give me break. I'm not anti marijuana, but I do feel there is a time and place to use it. The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible. Of course the economy as we know it would collapse but we would be too stoned to care. I thought the book would give a more factual account of the pros and cons I was dissappointed that it turned out to be such a fairy tale.
Positive	Perfect Fiction: One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Challenging, epic, and stunningly beautiful writing. As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in.
Negative	Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit.
Negative	I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.: This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype.
Negative	What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it: This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly.
Negative	"What's the fuss all about?: I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
Positive	Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude: I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali.
Positive	For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature.
Negative	Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time.
Negative	Disappointing - this is not the Colombia I have found: This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail.
Negative	Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it.
Negative	pointless: I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it.
Negative	Over rated and too politically correct: I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it.
Negative	Confusion. Intrepidation. Asphyxiation.: In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere.
Negative	Huh?: What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class.
Positive	A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it.
Negative	The worst book ever: When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read.
Negative	"Maybe I just don't get it: Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his ""favorite book ever"". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."
Negative	Started out good..: I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it.
Negative	Yawn.: Characters aren't interesting. The story is not compelling. The plot is not engaging. No mystery of any kind. Just dull. Much ado ... why?
Positive	One hundred years of solitude: I received confirmation that the book had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. The book was in great shape and the price was exceptional.
Negative	I hated this book: This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end.
Negative	"Disappointment: I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
Negative	"Magical, mystical piece of tripe: I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
Negative	Not for everyone: I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it .
Negative	Glad to be done with this one: I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book.
Negative	Absolutely Awful: I was very excited to read this book, and plunged right in when it arrived. As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is a complete waste of time-- so don't be fooled by people who claim this book is beautiful, like I did. It's anything but.
Negative	100 years of tortured reading: I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
Negative	The author put one over on us...: 10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!
Negative	Most overrated book of the century: So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
Positive	"A mirage of life: One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
Positive	amzing and intellectually enriching: the book talks about passion, war, defeat and glory, family dramas and political upheaval. the book is touching and a good reading for understanding latin america and its people. praise for garcia marquez for such a landmark novel.
Positive	I am in love with Gabriel Garcia Marquez...: A truly, life-changing experience. Magic realism, cyclical time, who could ask for anything more? Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for giving me this treasure and creating a cultural mythos for all of us.
Positive	a major classic: i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.
Positive	"One of the greatest novels!: Maybe G.G. Marquez's style is a little bit confusing. Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or ""Christ versus Arizona"" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."
Positive	A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book! Highly recommended!
Positive	A Sea of Latino Enchantment: I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds....
Positive	Takers and Leavers a Continuum: Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center.
Positive	Fantastical history of a common clan: This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention.
Negative	"Not impressed: I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never ""get"" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me. I regret I could not finish Nobel prize winning author or not- maybe at some future date I will go back and try again. Sorry ----"
Positive	Don't give up too soon.: This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens.
Positive	"In its own class....: I just finished reading ""100 Years of Solitude"". I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out."
Positive	"Fascinating but confusing: One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the ""first of the family line"" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."
Positive	Not for the impatient or inattentive: I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =).
Positive	Perfect: This is the definition of literature. Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition. I dare a serious, mature reader to pick this book up and not at least admire the writing. And the ending is something else altogether. Garcia-Marquez leaves the reader to ponder it. I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life. A MASTERPIECE.
Positive	Allegorical Fiction At Its Finest: The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space.
Positive	"Written with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!: One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of ""whaat!"" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!"
Positive	Opens up worlds: Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved. He has expressed a preference for 'The Autumn of the Patriarch'. But for the rest of us '100 Years' opens up worlds, opens up minds and opens up literature. If you haven't read it you are missing a dazzling milestone in 20th Century literature.
Positive	The great(est) American novel.: If you consider America the landmass on both sides of the equator betwixt the Atlantic and Pacific -- then American literature is truly enriched by everything that's written between Baffin Island and Cape Horn. As a young student in high school in American lit we read Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Fitzgerald -- great reading to be sure -- but only one slice of the expansive American experience. It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style
Positive	"A Fantastic Story: 100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. Throughout the history of this one family, it is hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction. The best comparison would be to ""Big Fish"" in which the stories are tall-tales, but yet not without fact. All in all, I recommend this book to everyone."
Positive	One Hundred Years of Solitude: An amazingly beautiful lyrical book which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book. And most delightful of all, the images linger long after the last page has been read.
Positive	A masterpiece: My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty.
Positive	Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear. This book is hard work, but only hard work yields great rewards.Best book in Latin American history and one of the 5 best books in human history.
Positive	One Hundre Years of Solitude: It is a wonderful journey where the author takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere.It may takes you a while to understad I read the book 3 times the first time I had it and so far I read it 8 times in my lifetime and it never stops to excite me.You want to forget your problems, travel to Macondo and learn about making gold and many other things! discover another world.
Positive	AMAZING book: There is very little that I can say that hasn't already been said. In short, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. It changed my life. It comes, as you might guess, VERY highly recommended.
Negative	"lesson in depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
Negative	Zzzz ...: One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story.
Negative	Very boring and confusing.: I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple.
Negative	Classic?: I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies.
Negative	"100 Years of Absolute Torture!: This book is long, dull, boring and confusing. It lacks the passion that makes Love in The Time of Cholera so beautiful. It make ""Tess of the D'Urburvilles"" look like a fast-paced romp. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"
Negative	A skilled rapist: The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it.
Negative	"All tell, no show: I read literary fiction, ""smart"" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."
Negative	Not a fun read: I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read.
Positive	"One of my best reads: A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of ""small town Latin America"". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His ""Novel Prize"" in literature was well deserved."
Positive	A Very Important Novel: One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece.
Negative	"100 years of slow reading: This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as ""Love in the Time of Cholera"".Give it a miss and try ""Blindness"" instead."
Negative	"big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
Negative	one hundred years of futility: This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic.
Negative	At page 250 I'm still struggling and am an avid reader!: I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down.
Negative	100 years of boreitude: I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do.
Negative	Confusing, Long and Boring: Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!
Negative	"I wanted to stab my eyes out...: This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a ""preferred book"" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it. I found it BEYOND tedious.What's wrong with me? Why does everyone love this novel and I found it so annoying?Sign me ~BEWILDERED"
Negative	Gave Up On It: found this a very weird book,just couldn't get going with it..maybe it was the translation..I might try again soon
Negative	Disappointed: I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book.
Positive	"So many Buendias: This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a ""classic to read over the summer"". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your ""things to read to remain well-rounded"" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"
Positive	It`s hard to read it but u will be amazed by it: It was the first great book i`ve read and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this book is great.It`s just perfect.i love GGM and his style.He just manges to express feelings so easily and everything in this book seems perfectly beliveable even if some things are magical and don`t get in connection with reality.This book is hard to review.One must read it to understand it.It`s just that one cannot resume this book here.This book must be experienced.
Positive	The World Repeating Itself...: The Story of Macondo and the Buendia family. What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us.
Negative	"GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!: CUZ THIS BOOK IS A ""SNOOZE FEST!""ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
Positive	Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you.
Positive	Among My Most Common Recommendations: As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!
Negative	"A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
Positive	Not for chickens: This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics.
Positive	An exceptional book; Beautiful!: There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it.
Positive	"I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've ""finished"" it. it always pulls me right back into it."
Negative	Enough is Enough: Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel.
Negative	Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
Negative	"Pretty stupid: Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or ""Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."
Negative	pointless: This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
Positive	Must read for everyone: It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally read this novel. It was well worth it, and I have read it again since then. It is a little hard to read, but it is a classic. I suggest that you use the family tree in the front of the book. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters. It may take you a little while to become completely imersed in the story, it starts out a little slow. But, it will be well worth it to keep going.
Positive	Still reading, but definitely a keeper: This is a classic that I've heard so much about. I enjoy a good fiction novel and thus far, am liking this book.
Positive	"One of my Favorite Books of All Time.: If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
Positive	An Absolute Good: I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life.
Positive	Magical Blend: Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century.
Positive	Oprahs may be the devil...: But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont.
Positive	"Thank goodness...: ... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, ""rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."
Positive	Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try.
Positive	One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!
Positive	"sensational and invigorating: ""One hundred years of solitude"" is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. The family is being torn by the desire for solitude, as the Colonel becomes very aware of, and the need for love. Many characters repeat history, doing what theyre ancestors have done. This is a splendid book that was and easy read, but had alot of messages underneath the explicit."
Positive	Use of language: I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily.
Positive	"Best I've ever read.: Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"
Negative	"Tedious: I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."
Negative	One of the few books I have stopped reading: I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?
Negative	"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book: I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
Negative	One Hundred Years of Solitude: Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it.
Positive	This book doesn't need anybody's blessing.: I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature.
Negative	100 years to read, a bramble of impenetrable verbage...: It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one.
Negative	Oh, my.: I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic.
Negative	I just don't get it...: After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea.
Negative	Struggling: I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves.
Negative	"Would've taken me 100 years to read: I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or ""difficult"" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."
Negative	The most painful reading and I did finish it.: My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny.
Negative	The emperor has no clothes: Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep.
Negative	Rambling, boring, and confusing: Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale.
Negative	"ARRRRRRRGH: I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
Negative	Terrible: I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one.
Negative	I don't like it: The story is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Most of the characters in the story have the same name , who suddenly die and get replaced with another character with the same name. It becomes confusing after a while to track who is who, who is dead or alive or who is the parent of who. I stopped reading about half way because I was lost and confused. The book is not a light or fun read, it requires great concentration and mental effort.
Negative	Appalling. . .: I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved.
Negative	One Hundred Years of Solitude: This book has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any author on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo.........but really, the nobel prize for literature for 400+ pages of such bore and repetitiveness. I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material. Nobel Prize..huh..make a good soap opera.
Negative	Glad I'm not alone in my opinion: I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it.
Negative	very bad paper quallity: very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase.
Negative	"Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point: I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a ""modern classic"", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."
Negative	I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....: I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me.
Negative	Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work: I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was.
Positive	Brilliant: I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way.
Positive	******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it.
Positive	Rewarding.: This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding.
Positive	A Beautiful Translation: This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!
Positive	Amazing!: This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!
Positive	The purest novel describing the human condition.: This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition.
Positive	100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)
Negative	What a drag!: I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!
Negative	This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money.
Negative	Not the best book ever: My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag.
Negative	Bad, bad, bad: What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading.
Negative	"Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?: Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this ""book"" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."
Negative	babbling: Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book. End of story.
Negative	I tried really hard....: I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next.....
Negative	UGH...one of the most confusing books I've read to date: This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money.
Negative	Book: This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all.
Negative	Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize.
Negative	Disappointing read: I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess.
Negative	Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.: I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn.
Positive	Well-written but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel.
Negative	Fine, if you're that way inclined: Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle.
Negative	Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read.
Negative	"The Emperor's New Clothes: Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here. And to prove it see the review by Ann Pate ""Annie Pate"". Kind of remind me of Yoko Ono selling John Lennon underwear, all you get is the name and dirty laundry. I will bet my bottom dollar that most people only read this because it was on Oprah's reading list."
Negative	Creative but boring and aimless: Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype.
Negative	I DON'T GET IT: I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material.
Negative	One hundred spastic pages: I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy. I hated it and only got as far as 158 pages before I gave up.
Positive	Not for everyone, but if it's for you .... Hold On!!: As many reviewers have noted, it is not an easy ready but well worth the time and certainly the effort.There is love, intrigue, war, life, death, laughter and tears. All told in the classic Latin American Literature style. What more can a reader ask for?Pick it up, read it and dream about the characters for days.
Positive	Excellent: A fascinating, difficult read. One Hundred Years of Solitude is a book that shouldn't be rushed through. Take your time and read at your leisure. If you hurry through it you will miss the beauty of this mesmerizing book.
Positive	Get the tape: I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical.
Negative	"I was surprised!: I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more ""light"" in both style and heart."
Negative	look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?: well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out.
Negative	"more stars than the firmament....: I wish I could have given this book ""no stars:"" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."
Negative	Super dissappointed: I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
Negative	A fad which no one will remember in 100 years: so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this book and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. But no one seems to stop and say that the events of the story are ridiculous and embarrasing. who wants to read about an old lady who makes candy for her family for generations? no one. and the romance portrayed is nothing short of farcical. it's a wonder he's a star in the literary universe.
Negative	"uncannonized: doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"
Negative	And the point is?: The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?
Negative	why fill your mind with trash?: this book was trash to my mind, why fill your mind with junk? What good knowledge are you getting from this book, knowledge that is valuable to the mind and soul? NONE! It does not leave you with a good feeling!
Negative	A book that left me indifferent: This was my second try after 30 years to read this book. First time I abandoned after some 20-25 pages, this time I got as far as page 150.And I got this far because I thought that maybe I'm missing something, it can't be that so many people praise this book and I am the only one who doesn't like it. But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed...
Negative	Extremely overrated: I can't understand the buzz about this book. I've tried to finish it twice and failed each time due to boredom.Perhaps it is better in Spanish. Is that why people love it? Personally, I can't understand why this is considered a classic.
Negative	Colombian family values -- part II: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?
Positive	Amazing!: Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time. Highly recommended.
Positive	Great mount for my 40 inch LCD TV: We love this corner mount. It is plenty big enough and stong enough for our 40 inch Sony LCD TV. It's just what we needed!
Negative	"Sorry but you're out of luck: Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40"" LCD. I'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw- if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part. My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display. The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part. They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part. I now have a $250 mount that is useless. Gotta think that if they are correct, I wound up with a used or salvaged unit."
Negative	Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far: This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle.
Positive	"A great mount: I purchased this mount to hold my 40"" Samsung LCD. I needed a mount that would attach to the back of the cabinet yet allow the TV to extend out - that's where the 27"" reach of this mount really shines. All the necessary hardware (and then some) were included. Solid yet flexible. I'm very satisfied w/ this mount."
Negative	Horrible: I purchased this card with the adapter. The card worked fine in my cell phone, but when I used plugged it into the adapter, my computer wouldn't read it. I know it wasn't my computer because other cards work fine. I contacted the company and one rep gave me the run around (via email). So I called them and the man was kind enough to send me a new adapter free of charge. That one didn't work either!! Waste of money!
Negative	Can't play the great games on this one...: This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps...
Negative	ATI needs to be more considerate: I purchased the Radeon 7000 and found that it was not supported by Madden 2003, so I went to replace it with one that was and found out that the ATI software was everywhere on my hard drive. ATI makes it impossible to remove the programs. I ended up having to format the whole hard drive!! I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Negative	EMachines Owners stay away!: This card is completely incompatible with Emachines' Tri-Gem Motherboards. I uninstalled all of my previous video drivers because that is what ATI told me to do when I unsuccessfully installed their card. Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs [$$$] a minute! I finally talked to Emachines' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC. I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy. I give this card 1 star because I can't give it any less than that.
Negative	Waste of money!: What a waste of money!!!! I was sooo exited about receiving this book, and especially because the reviews were so good. But a complete dissapointment. Hardly any pictures. Each hotel has a page or two briefly describing it, with artsy pictures which i hate, cause you only see a close of a stupid door handle, or a side of a table. IT MAKES ME INSANE WHEN PICTURES ARE LIKE THAT. PUT THE WHOLE PICTURE IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE! So if you think this book will show you complete pictures of hotel rooms, and lobbys your mistaken. Dont bother!
Negative	comment on previous user: i think the person who wrote the review from united arab emirates has nothing better to do than to criticize people get a job for heavens sake jesus christ superstar anichak bidoon tufaal
Positive	Good, but not the best.: Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.
Positive	A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.
Negative	"Disappointing: I bought this book as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other ""professionals."""
Positive	A book to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book. But this isn't like one of those health books that preaches all kinds of impossible advice. It's filled with really simple recipes. The ones I've tried are easy to make, and taste delicious. It's food for kids as well as adults. At last, we've got a book on the kitchen shelf that we can trust completely.
Positive	Easy to understand advice about diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines.
Positive	Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar: I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!
Negative	"Eat away diabetes ""Yuk"": the book was easy reading with some interesting facts.But...the recipes were not very palatable. I gave the muffins I baked to the birds because they tasted like bird food and the rest of the dishes I tried to feed to the dog.I do not recommend this book.There are more out there with more information about diabetes and better recipes."
Positive	"The Man! The Myth! The Hair!: This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song ""Rockin' This Joint Tonight"" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me."
Positive	Planning for elder care from a family point of view: Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis. Long-term Planning for Your Parents is a easy to read guide for families who are planning ahead or those who need to make informed decisions quickly about long term health care/living arrangements. What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research. I would recommend this booklet for parents and adult children, work/family resource professionals, and companies who provide resources for their employees on balancing work and family.
Positive	The Best Of The City Watch Books: In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. It was a great sequel to Guards,Guards and I really looked forward to reading it at the time. I enjoyed the introduction of the new members in the Watch since it gave the book a bit more variety. The plot between Carrot and Angua was also intriguing at the time. Im a big fan of Terry in general but the Watch( Commander Vimes in particular ) hold a special place in my heart. Keep up the good work Terry, your doing a great job.
Negative	No Footnotes?!: I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!
Positive	Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful! If you're driving, jogging, or even folding laundry, this audio narration is perfect for those times when you can't pick up the book and read for yourself.
Positive	Fell of my bed laughing!: This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I read. Now I have 10 others. This book was funny in so many ways. One of my favorite things is Mr. Pratchett's use of footnotes. The one about Bloody Stupid Johnson is the best! I highly recommend the whole Discworld series to every reader.
Positive	My first Pratchett book -- I'm hooked!: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive.
Positive	First Pratchett I've read and I'm very impressed.: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk.

Negative	"Kindle Price Too High: Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."
Negative	The book itself gets 5 stars: ...but for the money, they need to do a better job with the footnotes in a Terry Pratchett book. At some point there is a bookmark that gets embedded in the text, so all following footnotes are off by one and you have to do prev page to see the right one. Also part of another footnote or 2 get embedded the same way...kind of ruins the effect.
Negative	HarperCollins needs to get with the times: Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive.
Positive	"Nice and necessary: Meet Carrot, Angua, Vimes and the other watchmen in their debut performance as they leap into the Discworld. This is the first of the ""Vimes"" stories, so it is important for a basic knowledge of people you`ll be seeing a lot more of(depending on the humour of old man Pratchett). It`s no less funny than the others, while at the same time introducing detective work into the series as Vimes and his crew bumble along on a sinister case. They are, after all, policemen(no offense to policemen in general). Read it and love it. It`s different, but at least as good as the other Rincewind and Death books."
Negative	Warning!: This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]
Positive	Pratchett is Magical: Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story.
Positive	Terry Pratchett is a great author!: This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read.
Negative	"I didn't catch the catch: This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."
Negative	"Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star: There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."
Positive	"It's Abridged?: Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all. Corporal (now Captain) Carrot is the catalyst of the change in the Watch, hiring 3 new members. Lance-Constables Angua, Cuddy, and Detritus (the former splatter of the Mended Drum). With the ongoing gangfights with the dwarves and trolls, Detritus and Cuddy put aside their differences and, with the help of Carrot, recruit more members to solve the mystery of Discworld's first -and only- ""gonne""."
Positive	I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!: This was the second book I read by Terry. Since then, I've loved Discworld books about Ankh-Morpork (and especially the night watch). To get the full effect, read Feet of Clay, then Jingo right after this one.
Positive	Why Ankh-Morpork is in trouble: This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion.
Negative	"high school writing!: this is probably one of the worst books i have ever read. the prose is stilted and trite. i think the only reason it got published was because it is about a lesbian relationship. the characters are flat - no depth is allowed them. there are so many more and better books about lesbian relationships, start with those. if i were to rewrite it, i would yell ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" at the writer in a fit of rage. the sentences are reminiscent of Hemingway, except lack his literary value. everyone is rich and beautiful. it is the 90210 of the lesbian fiction world."
Positive	"Not Bad: I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
Positive	fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging.
Negative	Very disappointed: I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality. I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly. I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time. (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)
Negative	Max Keebles delivers the goods: Funny, funny funny...Unrestrained junior academic high jinks that will have your 14 year old, (and not to mention, YOURSELF) sprinting violently out of the room and into the streets screaming loud uproarious praise for this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece. This little jem of a purchase is a must for anyonetired of the usual hollywood fair. The character of Mark is by far the biggest scene-stealer in this shining cast of adolescent thespians! I have seen the glorious future and it has a name : Hail Maximus Keeble!
Negative	NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15 AND UP.: KIDS WILL LOVE IT. ADULTS WILL THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF. I CAN'T SAY I HATED IT. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FOR THE NICKELODEON CROWD.
Negative	No Widescreen: This is only avalible in full screen. Its lack of a proper aspect ratio. Disney is totally ignorant in this issue. When disney decides to release this in its in 1.85 anamorphic widescreen then I will buy it.
Positive	THE USUAL SUSPECTS: MY KIDS AND I LOVED THE MOVIE. IT'S YOUR USUAL KID OVERCOMING HIS FEARS AND BEATING THE BULLY STORY, BUT IT IS FUNNY. I THINK I MAY HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN MY KIDS.
Positive	Max Keeble is extremely cool: I wish Max Keeble was my father. He repersents all that is good & just in the world, and is the point of my obsession. However, the way they repersent the fat kid, I believe Robe was thy name, is perposturous and insulting towards my superior intelligence. He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him. I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties. With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk? IT WAS HER SEAT... The principal scared me a little bit, with his insane hi-jinks and all...The Saga Of Max Keeble makes me proud to be an American. Wear the red, white, and blue proud Max. Wear it proud.
Positive	An affordable collection: Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old.
Positive	A Must-Have DVD!: Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!
Positive	Strong Medicine: I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Shouldnt they be by now? I would buy all of them and be proud to add them to my movie collection.
Positive	Fans want more seasons of Strong Medicine: This was a really great show. I hope they hurry up and release more seasons. They got better with every season and the final episode was awesome. I want to own the entire collection!!! Please release them soon.
Positive	A Great Show: This is such a good show for women. I don't know why they don't put out more seasons on DVD. Every episode is compelling...it holds your attention. I love love love it!
Positive	Interesting: This is an interesting series for someone who likes watching medical dramas and it has a great cast as well.
Positive	Cooper and Kaplan: my heroes: After reading several academic papers concerning activity based costing I still wasn't convinced about the usefullness of the methodology. After reading Cost & Effect I revised my opinion on Cost Management. This book gives all the answers to effective Cost Management. It takes you from the ABC Age to the Activity Based Management Age and clearly helps you to understand what costs are alle about. Once you really understand the topics of this book you will be able to face and manage costs in whatever business you are in. Read it!
Positive	"Excellent Family and Social Psychology Novel...: This Reader's Digest Reissue of M. Millar's ""Stranger.."" is long overdue. Most interestingly, the author is very similar to her late husband, the better known Ross MacDonald (Ken Millar) in exploring hidden family secrets, without the hard-boiled detective (usually Lew Archer) that made her husband famous. But Mrs. Millar is expert at depicting all social classes, including Mexian immigrants, and their family interests, and has a sly humor that keeps this book amusing thruout. Possibly the book drags a bit, but still a top drawer family history suspense novel!"
Positive	Future: Despite being released at the turn of the 90's, 'Accelerator' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either 'FSOL' or 'LifeForms', and if they are remembered for anything it will be 'Papua New Guinea', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic. In 1992, it seemed as if intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate an irreversible shift in musical culture, and although FSOL didn't leave much of a legacy, this makes Basement Jaxx doubly pitiable.
Positive	"A great cd to listen to while driving cross-country!: This high performance album by FSOL was a ground-breaker when released in the early 90's. Some had heard the phenomenal track, ""Papua New Guinea"" with angelic singing by Riz Mazlin (AKA Neotropic, and Small Fish With Spine) on the ""Cool World"" Movie Soundtrack and wanted more. Well, this album delivers a sonic bouquet for the senses, that is sometimes harsh, dreamy, and does not disappoint. It has not left my CD changer in over 7 years."
Negative	Slow going: Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
Positive	First ok Second Great: There to cds on this album.The first one is Accelorator.Accelorator is very good like... i like a couple of the songs but this is more of a more techno album. It has more the plan one bass beats. But i love some of the songs. I mean i love all the songs but if you like hardcore tchno.... i would'nt suggest the first disk. But buy it anyway becauser the second disk is fabulous!! Its the papa New Gueni (or how ever you spell) remixes. Hibrid,blue states,simone,mellow and more remix papa new gueni. The second cd in my apinion is better but its always different opinions. you should defenetly put some thought in and buy this album. its great!!!!
Negative	"Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea: I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about ""Papua New Guinea"". Believe the hype about ""Papua New Guinea!"" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable (""Calcium"" and ""Expander""), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear ""Papua New Guinea"", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price."
Negative	Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat: This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down.
Positive	"Future Sound Of London - 'Accelerator' (Cleopatra): Good electronic/ambient artist's very first CD,originally put out in 1991.Took me awhile to land a copy of this title.FSOL is strictly a duo,members are Garry Cobain and Brian Douglas.Really quite a piece of work here,that is IF you dig this genre.Tracks that I remember to my liking were ""Expander"",their inspiring single ""Papua New Guinea""(have seen this tune mentioned in magazine reviews and articles before),""1 To 8"" and ""Pulse State"".Should appeal to some fans of The Orb,Meat Beat Manifesto,Sky Lab and Chemical Brothers."
Negative	"Seasoned practitioners--don't bother: This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
Negative	Designer Dependent: This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)
Negative	In-line Writing Style: This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake.
Positive	A Good Fun Guide to Swedish: I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided.
Negative	"Rather outdated Swedish: I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resväskan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
Negative	Helpful ? Not so much: Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas.
Positive	Beautiful Lullabuy Music: I love this CD. I play it for my son when he is going to sleep. Very peaceful, mellow and soothing.
Positive	invaluable: The authors have provided the quintessential study guide to The Canterbury Tales. This book is invaluable.
Negative	retarded: this boke sux. its a bunch of midevil poetry. it is so retarded and dum. i dont like it al all.Initially published in the Journal of Literary Criticism, 24(1).
Negative	"Be warned!: This collection of the entire Canterbury Tales (""translated"" -- how can English be ""translated"" into English? ""transposed"" or ""recast"" into Modern English is a more accurate way of putting it)is clearly and gracefully read by a variety of readers. BUT there is no accompanying Table of Contents, nor are the tales in the conventional order, so one has to search through 17 CD's in order to find a specific tale. I'd send it back if I hadn't torn the wrapper open -- which I had to do in order to discover this serious deficiency."
Positive	"The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore: Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."
Positive	"better than Decameron: To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you 've got to read ""Decameron"" by Boccaccio and ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" by Boethius.Read them and send me news on the online-review. ."
Positive	storytelling and fun: A fantastic book with great stories of many a people. Unless pertaining an excellent vocabulary a dictionary or thesaurus can help with those words which look as if their been made up. These stories have a twist in almost every one of them and take you by surprise ensuring a smile upon ones face.
Positive	Depicts every level of 14th century England.: Thoroughly interesting. The organization of this book must of been very creative for the time. A group consisting of everyone from a cook to a knight set out on a religios pilgrimage to Canterbury. A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy.
Negative	bad version to read: The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Putting the definitions of words in line with the text, rather than as footnotes or end notes, disrupts the flow of reading. It quickly gets confusing as to what is original text and what is editorial comment. I'm off to find another edition only partway into the first poem.
Negative	Too bad I bought this book.: I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet. Of course, the story is out of copyright, and you'll find it all over the Internet, in complete.Don't waste your money like I did. Even worse, I never even read the book.My rating is only on the size of the book, because like I said, I never read it, and I am forced to issue a rating (I only wanted to enter a comment).
Negative	"A Good Translation but still disappointed: This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
Negative	Kindle edition formatting is horrible!: The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible.
Negative	Don't buy the Kindle edition: This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read.
Positive	Narrative poetry at its best very comical: Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily.
Positive	A good translation.: The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart.
Positive	A Review: The Canterbury Tales was a notably written book,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect story. It was very interesting to read this book and I reccommend it for any others who like to read short little tales as are in this book.
Positive	Children's Version! Not for the literary afficianado...: I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation.
Positive	The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue: This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well.
Positive	Recommend this seller: I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller.
Positive	Chaucer appeals to everyone: The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging.
Negative	"The Canterbury Tales by a modern hack poet: This set of CDs is a fraud! Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a ""translation"" by some hack poet. So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you. But it is definitely not Chaucer."
Negative	Why is Chaucer so great?: Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least.
Negative	"Wait long enough and anything becomes a ""classic"": Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."
Negative	"For Simpsons fans.: If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."
Positive	Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast: At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking.
Positive	"Classic: In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers ""Canterbury Tales"". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."
Positive	It's a very through pocket book that can guide you in Laos: This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. I purchased this book in order to learn the language at a quicker and more simplified pace. It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well. Even though studying an entirely new language can be laborious, Mr. Cummings has made it easy for anyone to be bilingual, even multi-lingual.
Negative	transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.
Negative	insufficient to teach this tonal language: this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced.
Negative	"No Lao-to-English!: This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
Negative	Yawn De Florette: This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film.
Positive	Beautiful and touching: I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/book I've ever seen/read. I love this story so much because it is so absolutely realistic and that it is human nature to do what a lot of the characters in the film did. There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book? (I read the French version).
Positive	A Feast for the Eyes and Ears: Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight.
Positive	Great story !: The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot).
Negative	"Wonderful Movie...Bad Transfer: Since purchasing a DVD player a year and a half ago, I have often come across reviews that bemoan the ""transfer quality"" of a particular title. Now...I know what they are talking about.While this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I was extremely disappointed in the picture and sound quality. Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the ""transfer"" 1 star. Since this is not likely to be re-released as a ""Special Edition"" I would reluctantly recommend buying this title, only because it will have a longer shelf life than the VHS edition."
Positive	Definitely worth watching, although the lesser of two parts.: Although new to French Cimema, this film has introduced me to some wonderful acting and cinematography. The set is impressive and the music is memorable.Having watched Jean de Florette first, I believe it warrants five stars of it's own accord. Manon des Sources is far superior, but there aren't many films that hold a candle to Manon, foreign language or otherwise.I certainly agree that this has to be seen to appreciate Manon. With these two films being one of the rarities in film making, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Positive	WOW!: As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs.
Negative	Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo: I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space.
Negative	Too expensive to not offer carry handle/strap: Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio.
Positive	love it: Thank you for making my baby happy, he is very into this type of music. just waiting for the next cd
Positive	VERY COMPELLING DOZIER ON ATTITUDE ,AND CHANGE: MILTON ROSENBERG,THE AUTHOR OF WHOM I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH, DOES A OUTSTANDING JOB OF EXPRESSING FACTORS,IN THE CONSISTENCY,OR LACK THREREOF CONCERNING HIS PHILOSOPHY OF CHANGE,AND THE VARIOUS ATTITUDE'S,LEADING UP TO THAT,FACTOR OF CHANGE.......THIS BOOK STRICKLY FOR THE VERY INTELLECTUAL,OF WHICH I'M NOT IN THAT CLASSIFICATION,STILL MADE INTERESTING READING,FOR A LAYMAN....
Positive	"The closest thing to time travel: This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."
Negative	Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here!: I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great.
Negative	Interested in the great ship? Don't look here.: I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works.
Negative	"1986 NOT 1912: If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend ""The Night Lives On"" by Walter Lord."
Negative	"False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.: Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
Negative	The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......: The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book.
Negative	Awful book: This book was horrible. I've read many books on Titanic, and this has to be the worst. If you want to read a good book, check outA Night to Rememberor getTitanic: An Illustrated HistoryHalf of this book deals with the finding of the ship in '85. I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic.
Negative	"Not the best: I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron's film. Many of the ""facts"" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it. It almost seems as if he is trying to convince everyone that he was a co-discoverer of Titanic and Robert Ballard's best friend. I would recommend another author, one who actually has a love for Titanic and isn't trying to make himself look better."
Negative	This book is auful !!: If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it. Much of the information is wrong (Frank Tower ??? PLEASE !) The authors reliance on foul language to make his point ... all of this makes this book an annoying piece of trash unfit for anyone to read !
Negative	False: I'm am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built.(in my opinion)And this book was very in accurate. The authors didn't really focus on what really happened. If I were a critic I'd give it... two thumbs WAY DOWN!
Positive	New facts learned and old ones enlightened: When I first saw this book in my local book store about a year ago, I thought: Great, another book on the Titanic giving the same old facts and the same stories that every book on the Titanic contain. But then I picked it up and started reading, I learned about the more about the feelings of the officers and crew that night and the feelings of the men who found her. Although the book jumps around a bit, it was still enjoyable to read.
Positive	Pellegrino is the best.: I love Charles Pellegrino. I read this book four years ago and have read other books by him which possess the same brilliant scientific analyses yet contain an intimacy of the subject rarely found in nonfictional books. I could easily imagine standing beside him looking over the water in sorrow. Although the movie was truly outstanding, it cut some of the most crucial scenes out (the radio controllers). READ the book to find out what the movie missed!!
Positive	Enlightening and spell binding: I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!
Negative	its too drown out: Birthright uses the battle system rules that are o.k. but they are not as fun as doing a mass battle by group.
Positive	Great: A good one... and a few more words to fill out my review. I'd like to be able to just rate movies and shows without having to do this... someday.
Negative	Lodge Book: For the price of the book I was looking for more recipes not a history of cast iron cooking. Not worth the price
Negative	the complete book of dutch oven cooking: this book spends too much time on history and stories. beginners need to know how to determine the temperature of the oven. advanced cooks may know how many coals to put on and under but charcoal is better to learn with.twelve chapters of history and differances of cast iron and aluminum is too drawn out. the final blow is when there are only 19 recipes and most do not appeal to me.
Negative	"This is ""The Comlete book of Dutch oven cooking"": Or this is catalouge book and nothing more.If some buy Lodge cast iron pot or pan,must have this book free of cost."
Positive	THE GREATEST FILM SCORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIES: THIS IS FANTASTIC SCORE FOR ANY KIND OF A MOVIE, NOT JUST A CHEESY JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE! THE SCORE FOR THIS MOVIE WAS NOT ON THE VERSION OF THE MOVIE THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE USA IN 1962. HAVING NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL, UNEDITED, JAPANESE VERSION OF THE MOVIE, I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, IT INCLUDES EERIE, SCARY KIND OF MUSIC (YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE MONSTERS CREEPING UP ON YOU, RIGHT OUT OF THE OCEAN), TRADITIONAL JAPANESE PERCUSSION, POP MUSIC, CHANTING, A LITTLE TIN PAN ALLEY, BLUES, LOUNGE MUSIC, MILITARY MARCHES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS COMING NEXT. I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE WHOLE THING............
Positive	Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!
Positive	"Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
Positive	"a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion: Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On ""Don't Throw Your Love Away"" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on ""Needles and Pins"" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!"
Negative	A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.: The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!
Positive	Great Bed....Except for a Demon Dog: This bed is great, but since my dog is a puppy and has decided to destroy everything in sight - I had to take it from him to salvage what I could in hopes he will settle down with age. He has already destroyed my soaker hose around the foundation of my house, most of my plants, my sprinklers, a lot of the siding on my house....and more (the swings never had a chance). I think this thing is great and looks like it will work well, but I will have to wait to hopefully get its full use. One of th great things about it is that it has the cedar in it to prevent bugs and stuff from getting on him. I just have to hope this destruction phase will end soon. Enjoy.....
Positive	Looking forward to reading other books by this author: This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
Negative	buyer beware...this product and the company are a rip-off: this is a terrible product from a company that should not be in business. the scooter never worked...their solution was to send me a couple of neew components nad have me install. when that did not work, they had me run test after test after test...to no avail. the scooter does not work to this day. i filed a complaint with amazon...amazon did a lousy job of investigating and determined that the warranty was expired (30 day warranty!). of course it expired...they took a week each time to respond to my requests for help. the warranty was half over by the time i got the scooter after ordering it. i am disputing the charge through my credit card company, hope that gets my money back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXPERIECE THE SAME THINK I DID.BUYER BEWARE!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!
Negative	Extremely cheap and poorly constructed, DO NOT BUY!: Everything about this scooter is incredibly cheap and shoddily put together. The seat broke under my weight (I weigh 165, well below the stated limit for this product) and half of the bolts holding the scooter together rattled themselves off within a few blocks of riding it. Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this inferior product.
Negative	this scooter it only for kids scooter only 4 weeks: I am 22 years old men and i bought this scooter for the speed by ivoog scooters for 400 dollars with free shipping, and i like it,i have this scooter two months with problems, and the only big problem is that the wheels are very small to enjoy the ride safety,controller will stop working and then the company will leave you will not help ,and will tell you what could we do.and it not comfortable because it do not have any shocks so i do not recommend it all for adults that need to ride long trip,so adults for you good do not buy any xtreme scooters they are for kids you be not happy if you buy it.i bought the ezip 1000 scooter this is the best of the best scooter, with the x500 scooter i am 140 lb i ride 17+MPH and with ezip 1000 i ride with the top speed of 16+MPH and it fille really like 20MPH, and its very very comfortable so this for you adult you will love it and you be very very happy with it you see....
Positive	So far so good!: The scooter has a good looking, the bateries last up to 45 minutes of continuos use but, need to change fuses evry long ride or every charging process, so far so good!
Negative	Dull and Annoying: A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour.
Positive	a teenagers opion: Ok I really like this movie I mean the story line was awesome. I watched it so many times at a friends house then borrowed it to take home. My mom watched it and hated it. She did not like the way the girls danced.... i dunno I thought it was great....
Positive	"Piper is NOT Ugly!: Coyote Ugly is a sexy ""feel good"" movie. We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz. It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the ""F"" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."
Negative	This movie was trite.: The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
Negative	Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars.
Negative	pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.
Negative	EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!: I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire.
Positive	Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!: Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen. You won't be disapointed if you see it. The actors and actress' are wicked!i give it 2 Thumbs up
Negative	Hate widescreen format: Loved the movie, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format.
Negative	I want my money back: This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special. Save your money and treat yourself to a Big Mac meal. It will go down easier than the characters in this movie.
Negative	Boring: My friend likes this movie so I checked it out. I didn't like it. Kind of boring. Couldn't get through the whole thing. Fastforward solved the problem :)
Positive	Birthday present for my niece.: My niece specifically requested this movie for her birthday. She loves the movie! It was exactly what she wanted (of course, she asked for it, duh!)
Positive	GREAT DANCING: The story line for this movie was different - something new - which I believe we all need in this day!The dancing & music was great - I have the sound track and I have the movie in DVD and watch it alot. It's just great and Piper is wonderful.I'd love to see a sequel...........
Positive	Surprise! A good story: This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching.
Positive	Loved it: Don't know why but can't stop watching this movie. Love the story and the setting of the film
Positive	Entertaining: I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
Positive	Great movie!: We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!
Positive	"GOOD LOOKIN'!!: My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
Negative	Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad..............: Wow. This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything.
Negative	Just another pretty face: This movie deserves every harsh review it gets. However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie. If you have a brain and like to use it, this movie is probably not for you. What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff.
Positive	Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
Negative	A unique torture-technique: I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon.
Negative	"If only I could convince my wife: I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another ""Flashdance,"" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."
Negative	"Unnecessary...: Hoping this ""unrated"" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent ""unrated"" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a ""harder"" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of ""Coyote Ugly"" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick."
Negative	These chicks think they're so cool and tough: Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience. Stupid women.
Negative	Total cheese-fest: I can't believe movies like this get made! This movie is CHEESY from start to finish. The characters are empty, the plot is thin, and the cliches are in abundance. Buy/rent this movie only if you want to laugh at the money you just wasted.
Negative	men are pigs: This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked.
Negative	Sexist film: Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today.
Negative	Not worth buying...a renter at best: A plot and story that has been done before, better. Miserably bad acting: Tara Banks, Leanne Rymes. Only highlight: John Goodman. Better yet, rent something else.
Positive	Cool, sexy and wild...: This is one of my favorite movies ever! It is a good story,a story that tell us to follow our dreams... I just say 1 thing to all the people that had [not] seen the movie... SEE IT!! It is just fabulous.
Negative	Dumb movie: This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
Positive	Enjoy: I really enjoyed this movie and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd. It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on.
Negative	"How pitiful: I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of movies. When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn't very excited about it. But ""what the heck, I'll watch anything once."" First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I'm sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that's about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys."
Positive	Excellent Movie!: When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!
Positive	I love this movie: This product is really great for my trip. It also came in early and I am enjoying the movie.
Positive	One of the Best movies I Have Ever Seen: I have watched this movie with my daughter about a million times over the last 5 years, and I can honestly say that it never gets old! The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman's finest performance. The movie will leave you feeling warm at heart over and over again. The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city. There is nothing in the movie that has a WOW factor to it, but that doesnt retract anything from the story to me. If you haven't seen it, you could do a lot LOT worse than to buy this movie.
Positive	I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!: I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!
Positive	More true than most people realize: As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want.
Negative	too much gyrating and not enought interest for me: Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia.
Negative	Iz love Tira but this is still abd: really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club.
Positive	An Inspiration!!: This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.......and i do not care what you other people say about it!! A young song writer goes into the big NYC to sell her music and struggles without much money till she finds out about a bar needing some work......COYOTE UGLY!......finally she is making money and falling in love with an Australian Hottie....the rest is for you to see......i loved the story line of this movie....it makes anyone want to go out and reach their goals and dreams!........TWO THUMBS UP!
Negative	Cringeworthy.: Viewed: 2/06Rate: 32/06: Coyote Ugly displayed a fair story that made my skin to crawl. A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations.
Negative	"sticky sweet, predictable...: I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable. 30 minutes into it, I almost changed the channels. But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every ""twist"" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better."
Negative	Make it Stop!: My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!
Negative	A nightmare!: I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
Positive	good movie: I liked the movie I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first movie I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed.
Positive	Love this movie: One of my all time favorite movies. Quality of viewing was very poor, but Amazon was extremely helpful and refunded my price. Would try to rent again!
Positive	this is jerseys movie: piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. she is an empowering actress and deserves an academy award nomination. the whole cast is great though. this movie is excellent.
Negative	Special effects?!: Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again.
Negative	"This is a 2 star movie if you're not a girl and under 16: This movie is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls. The guy in this movie does one of the worst acting jobs Ive ever seen, and nothing ever really happens. If you have a good taste for movies, then you shouldnt like this movie. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a ""cute"" story, but thats about it. (Also, no bar like that is going to have only 1 bouncer, gimme a break!)"
Positive	Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
Negative	"excruciating...: I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, ""Look how cute and adorable I am."" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."
Positive	Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???
Negative	"Good intentions... Horrible execution.: Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ""Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!"" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with ""Slap Her, She's French"" this year."
Negative	Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
Negative	"A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the ""Frat Boy"" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the ""small town girl goes to the big city"" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the ""T"" & ""A"".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the ""acting"" is better on those cable shows."
Negative	Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever.
Positive	"Coyote Ugly ROCKS!: Coyote Ugly is one of the best movies i've seen so far. When i walked out of the theatre after watching Coyote Ugly, i was like ""WOW! That was a really good movie"". The actors are fantastic, cinematography was good, on top of that, the SOUNDTRACK is really really cool. I immediately went to the stores to get the soundtrack to the movie. Some people think that this movies has a lot of ""sexual"" content, but i think it's nothing more than just a few pretty ladies in nice looking outfits having the time of their lives. This movies is a MUST-WATCH and certainly worth the money to get it. Trust me, it's really fantastic."
Negative	i hated this movie: I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well.
Positive	Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie.
Negative	Another tax-loss movie?: You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent.
Negative	Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.: I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother.
Positive	"A Great Sexy Movie!: All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
Positive	"It's Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word ""Miramax"" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."
Negative	Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up.
Negative	"Bruckheimer Should Stick With ""Guy"" Movies...: I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to ""The Big City"" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."
Positive	Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness.
Negative	One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing...
Negative	really weak Film: nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
Negative	Stage Fright Is Not Genetic: Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure.
Positive	"Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.: This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what ""Queer"" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."
Positive	"Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2.0: Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: ""Push It,"" ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,"" ""Temptation Waits,"" ""Special"" Rating: 8/10"
Positive	Great CD: Definitely my favorite band. We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more.
Positive	I can't get enough of this 'garbage': Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again).
Positive	"A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans: This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. Such, direct and bold songs as ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""Pust It"", and ""When I Grow Up"" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive!"
Positive	Not as good as the first: With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
Positive	Is anybody here rating the Tab book instead of the album?: Great album. Always was, always will be, one of my favorites. Went looking for a guitar tab book on Amazon. Found one that said it had 542 reviews for it. Opened a review; not about the book, about the album. Opened another, and another, and another, you get the picture. Nice going Amazon.
Positive	One of best pop/rock cds: Garbage is here again!!!! This cd is (little) better than the first and is worth buying. This cd is little old but I listen to it as I listen to newer cds. It is one of my best cds.
Positive	"I LOVE THIS CD!!!: I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"
Positive	"garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,: kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to ""the trick is to keep breathing"". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to ""BIG DADDY"""
Positive	One of the best C.D.'s I've heard in a long time!!!!: This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive	I want to be Shirley Manson!: This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great.
Positive	I love this CD!!! It's awsome!!!!: I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!
Positive	One of the best CD's of 1998!: Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!
Positive	"Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.: Garbage rules so much, it's impossible to describe in words. Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There are over twenty-five so far, and still much more to come, I'm sure. I don't need to use the playlist function on my CD players--I can listen to each. Besides Version 2.0, buy every other one they have out! ""I think I'm Paranoid"", ""Only Happy When it Rains"", ""Stupid Girl"", and ""13x Forever""(""13x Forever"" is only on the ""Special"" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. You have to hear them. GUFFYPUP'S APPROVAL RATING (1-10): 26"
Positive	This CD ROCKS !!! This CD is GREAT GARBAGE !!!: Listen folks, you want a GREAT CD ! Garbage is version 2.0 is IT! This is one of thje BEST CDs I have purchased in a long time and my very 1st from AMAZON ! What a great price and service ! I work for a company involved in the design and creation of home and commercial theater, etc. I took this CD in the day I received it and let me tell you, what a demo ! We were all ready to party ! 500 QUALITY watts, 2 SUBS,5 Channels ! Thought we would crack the cement floor ! I have never purchased a CD like this with such cool tunes on ALL TRACKS. Keep on a rockin Garbage ! RKNM (Rockenem) in Portage WIsconsin !
Positive	There are only a couple of tracks that aren't brill!!: Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'
Positive	version 2.0-newer, faster, better: after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!
Positive	"This CD rules!: I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."
Positive	"The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. And not only to hear it. I bought it immidiately. It is one of the last (or perhaps, the first?) bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound. Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" or ""You Look So Fine""), sometimes they sound angry (""I think I'm Paranoid""), but all the songs that are here get along really well. In spite of all the differences between the songs, the album sounds consistent. Energy, joy, sadness, tenderness, love, hate. What else does anyone want from music?"
Positive	"I liked it much more that the first CD...: I've enjoyed this CD so much! I bought ""Garbage"" and really liked it. Then my friend bought me ""Version 2.0"". I'm really impressed with the instrumentation and the lyrics. I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!!!"
Negative	Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band.: Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore.
Negative	Weak...: Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak.
Negative	"Garbage is exactly that......: I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at ""art rock"" BORING"
Negative	"Ditch the Producer: Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. ""2.0"" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."
Negative	Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available.
Negative	one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.
Positive	You Betta Buy This!: What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff. Wonderful melodies, brash sounds, singalong hooks, and you can dance to it too. Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM!
Positive	"Absolutely Outstanding: I must admit that I'm addicted to ""Version 2.0."" The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player. Described by Shirley Manson herself as ""mongrel-esque,"" the band's style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment."
Positive	"warning: this CD is extremely addictive: All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"
Positive	"Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. ""Special"" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), ""Push It"" and ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."
Positive	"I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is ""When I Grow Up."" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."
Negative	I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. My rating? I'll give version 2.0 a C+ for a good attempt
Negative	I was disappointed: Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are.
Positive	"Garbage-Version 2.0: This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be ""Special"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". ""When I Grow Up"" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"
Positive	"I'm a Garbage addict.... and this rocks!: This is the best CD I've ever heard! Once again, Shirley rocks on with those dark tunes. But this seemed a little happier-especially ""When I grow Up"" and ""Special""-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! This is certainly ""Special""!"
Positive	"Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
Positive	"Temptation Waits...: After a great debut, garbage made an album that made pop world better. With the songs like ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Push It"", ""Special"", ""Temptation Waits"", and a slow ballad ""You Look So fine"" they conquered the music world. Shirley Manson's voice was so great although a sad one...and a little bit creepy. The lyrics are quite creepy too. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine"
Positive	"One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" and most of all the sparkling ""Special."" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like ""Hammering in My Head"" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever."
Positive	"THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE.: This CD is a wonderful outstanding effort. My only worry is that they put all their eggs in one basket....How can they do better than this one? Every song is a wonder of its own. My favorites ""Special"", and ""Temptation Waits"". In my opinion this should of won as best CD of the year at the grammies over Lauryn Hill handsdown. Don't miss this one."
Positive	"Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track ""Temptation waits"" reminded me a lot of the power that ""Supervixon"" had, & ""Special"" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks."
Positive	OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. GET IT!!! Or if you are repelled@by the negative comments of others, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE FIRST!!!!@If you are going to read a book read Dangerous Angels: The Weetzie Bat books by Francesca Lia Block!
Positive	Garbage is the best Glam Rock band!: Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. Their mix of heavy techno and heavy alternative rock makes this band unique and special..oh yes by the track on this CD. Very good CD, Garbage is original and great to rock out to and also to mellow out to...buy the CD!
Positive	"good cd: this is a really good cd. i think that the song "" i think i'm paranoid "" is a funny song. and the rest of the cd is great"
Positive	I agree: ... with all the other glowing reviews. I just want to add ... this is great headphone music! Put on this CD and some really good bass-boost stereo headphones. You will be blissed-out!
Positive	"Garbage Is Anything But...: While I only give Blondie 5 stars, Garbage is my next all-time favorite band! This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like ""Special"" and ""Push It"" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!"" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!"
Positive	"More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: ""I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.""Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly ""Push It"" and ""Special"", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: ""Temptation Waits"", ""When I Grow Up"", ""Medication"", and ""You Look So Fine.""Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."
Positive	Great CD!: I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one. (Alanis Morissette) I got a pleasant surpise, since this one is just as sweet as the first one!!!
Positive	I never get tired of it!: Not many cd's can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Version 2.0, however, is one of the elite few who will have you praying for Garbage's next cd! So every one, go out there and buy this cd cause it has to be the best I have ever heard!
Positive	"Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!: if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
Negative	"Changed too much in too little time.: The band tried to pioneer a little too much into dance and electronica too early. Though ""The Trick..."" was the only good song with their new sound, ""Hammering..."" and ""Sleep Together"" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of ""Special"" and ""The Trick..."" and go from there."
Negative	Paranoiac...: This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
Positive	Love this CD!: I have loved Garbage for a long time now... and I have her first two CD's and I am so excited that she's come out with another one. Shirley is AWESOME! I love her voice.. and I don't believe that anyone else has a voice like hers. Garbage ROCKS!!
Positive	You gotta love garbage: After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!
Positive	if ya like the first one, you're gonna love this!!!!: This is a great CD and all I can say is that if you're a fan of the first album....you have to get this one.
Positive	Good: I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END
Positive	pertty good: I do enjoy this ablum and would recommend it. I am not sure if it will be found to be as strong as some of their other music, however, it you are a Garbage fan, I think this will work for you.
Positive	"the best album on the market: i started out taping garbage songs off the radio, till i figured out i could get them all on a cd. so i bought it & i still play it non stop. wherever i am in the house, its playing. i actually bought this before their first album, but i havent been disappointed in any of their music. this is an album you can let play through, without ever wanting to skip. my favs are ""when i grow up"" and ""temptation waits"", but they kinda rotate depending on my mood. this cd has a song for every mood, so go buy it now, you won't be disappointed."
Positive	"Great CD by a great group.: This is a great CD. Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD. Songs like ""Temptation Waits"", ""The Trick is to Keep Breathing"", ""Sleep Together"" and others really show off the quality of this group in a way you would otherwise not know. If you like what you've already heard from Garbage, you really need this CD, you will not be disappointed."
Positive	An amazing follow-up...: I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better.
Positive	"THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!: This CD is the bomb. GET IT! It's much more organized than the first. Garbage is unique, compared to other bands. I love this CD. It is my life. HELP I""M A SHIRLEY MANSON WANNABE! I love you garbage!! I'm telling you guys, if you don't get this, you are missing out on SOOOO much!GET IT!"
Positive	New Type of Funk: new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. I really like this one folks, it has a new type of funk that sets it aside from all imatators. If you buy just one cd this year let it be this one, it all starts here.
Positive	GREAT ,BRILLIANT ,SUPER!: I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it.First thing I can say is that this album is one of the best albums in the world!All the songs are great and I cannot spend a day without listening to it.Shirley's vocal performance is perfect as usual!After listening to Garbage's albums the other albums don't give me the same pleasure.GARBAGE is surely the best band in the universe for me and the members are really great people!I'm sure they will continue their success with their 3rd Album and if I was going to a deserted island, one of the 3 things that I'd take would be VERSION 2.0 (the others would be the batteries and my CD player for listening to it :))
Positive	"A very ""Special"" album.: I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."
Positive	"Garbage is great!: Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like ""Stupid Girl"" ""Queer"" or ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is ""Temptation Waits."" ""Hammering in my Head"" is great, too. The most popular ones, ""Push It"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."
Positive	Just when you think it couldn't get any better.: I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs. A perfect application for parties, driving and getting things done.I'll wear this disc into a coaster in no time.
Positive	sticky: Garbage did it again! Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower.
Positive	Don't forget to take out this Garbage!: I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic.
Positive	AWESOME!: Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed.
Positive	I loved every minute of the cd: I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album.
Positive	this CD rocks!: This album is wonderful.I must tell you the first time I listened to it, I loved every single song on the disc.The lyrics are catchey and the beats are incredible!Buy this CD and you will NOT be wasting your money!
Positive	Now THIS is music!: Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man. I'm so happy I have it + it exists.
Positive	One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !: Truly the best album I've ever listen to. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. I love Shirley's voice, its sultry and seductive, and she really rocks. All the tracks are great! Go out and buy it! Its definitely worth it.
Positive	"""Special"" CD: This is a wonderful CD, Shirley Manson has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. I was hooked the first time I heard them, the songs are great."
Positive	An amazing CD. . . the best of '98-'99: Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!
Positive	"Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. But Version 2.0 comes very close to the thrill I got from the first CD. It's less ""spooky"" than their freshman effort, but more ""powerful""."
Positive	This is the type of 'Garbage' you don't throw away!: Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day.
Positive	Adds new fun to the track: The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it.
Positive	Good addition to your Brio collection.: Even though it's a bit pricey for what you get, it's a fun addition to your collection. It gives the little engineer another interesting way to manipulate a train, especially battery operated trains. I would recommend buying more than one set/box if you have alot of track - it's fun to keep changing the direction of the trains to make them follow the many different directions of track. I have one set now and plan to buy another.
Negative	Not PCI Port: I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it.
Negative	stinks: this thing smells and transfers the smell to your hands. very chemical like poisonous odor. put it in a cotton sock until this comes, then will throw it away.IMAK Stress Ball, Grey (Pack of 4)
Positive	A good season: I've watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item.
Negative	Terrible season. Terrible stories.: First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6.
Negative	cheaper at target: I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....
Positive	This was a Great buy and a good shipment!: I recommend this product and i had no problem with the company that it came from. It got here on time and in Great shape.
Negative	One Tree Hill Season 7: This was a good product overall. it was just bad quality. it seemed like it was burned off of an original. Every disk says disk 1 the title scene is blurry and parts of the episodes are pretty choppy.
Negative	BOOTLEG: The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. Super annoyed and disappointed with my purchase. . . .
Positive	One Tree Hill: Anyone can get into this show. For all ages. It's very addicting and i wish it never ended. Worst part is Chad leaving
Positive	One Tree Hill: Great cast. Great episodes. Great price. I love every single episode from this series. sad to see it come to an end.
Negative	So Corny.: First, I want to say I watched the entire season and have seen the entire series. This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money.
Positive	One Tree Hill Season 7: This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international.Package was not damaged in the slightest and ive enjoyed watching every second of this season as it has not yet been released on DVD in Aus yet.Good work!
Positive	very satisfied: The quality of the product was perfect. Brand new. It was sent out it two days. I was very satisfied.
Positive	Very pleased: No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Haven't played the DVDs yet but they are new in packaging so any problems with DVD would not be seller fault.
Positive	Love this show!: I love this show, I bought this season to complete my collection. They have made the boxed set boxes a lot smaller in size over time, but still packed with all the great episodes of this fantastic show!
Positive	Guardian Heroes 2 vs. Sega Saturn guardian Heroes: All in all this game is amazing!!!I'm sure all yuo old school sega fans out there know what I'm talking about. The ground breaking genre defining Guardian Heroes!orgionally, the first Guardian Hero game came out on the legendary sega saturn and there was and still is nothing like it. If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game! It was a bit sad to know that they've all died, but it was absolutely a must for the developing storyline.If you've played the first one I'm sure you'll agree the way the story goes is PERFECT! I wish I could give this game 10 stars...Long Live Prince Valgar!!!
Positive	Not long enough: This game is fast paced and action packed. All the moves are easy, the versus mode is fun, controls are tight. 2 minor complaints: The game is too short, and the music leaves a little to be desired. But you'll be too busy fighting hordes of enemies to notice.
Negative	"Crappy Guardian Villains: Do you want a game that makes you frustrated? Do you want a game that gives you an excuse to throw your GBA at a wall and hit it with a hammer? Do you want a game, that makes you bang your head on a wall over and over again? If so, buy the game! If not, oh sweet mary do buy it! Please do not buy this! Please! This game is self-proclaimed to be a difficlulty level for children. You would need to have the devotion of a Shaolin Monk to master this game! It's soooo fricking hard! It's like trying to play Mario Party 4 while having a seizure. THe Japanese to English translations are terrible! The story make no sense, like all japanese games. There is this ""soul of hero"" trying to fight ""the choas"". Oh and If you die, you either get to use your soul to revive you to the last check-point, or trade in your soul for ""Devil Mode"". ""Devil Mode"" is when you get unlimited hp and magic for 6 minutes and you die. THis game isn't worth your time, or money."
Positive	Jula Bell gives me shivers: This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Cudos to Kent. My favorite part is the final cut by underground artist Jula Bell. I was so pleased to hear her singing on something like this. Cheers to Kent for having the guts to take a chance with someone who is a truly cutting edge artist known for her integrity. I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his. It's simplicity and bold melody is the heart and soul of the soundtrack. Why wasn't this song in the movie? Buy this cd to hear one of the best female vocalists out there---
Positive	"Sting's the Star: The majority of cuts on the CD are run of the mill soundtrack fair. That being said, the CD is worth the purchase price for ""Until"" written and performed by Sting. I predict it will become an ageless favorite!"
Positive	A Must for Kate & Leopold fans: The music on this cd is a lot like the movie...different, but with a great romantic edge to it. The only thing is that to enjoy it, you need to like music with no words that can put a picture in your mind...this does exactly that. If you loved the movie, I would DEFINATELY recomend this cd.
Positive	"Excellent!: The soundtrack for ""Kate and Leopold"" is an excellent one, and the beautiful and dreamy musical segments evoke warm and happy memories of the delightful film and the scenes which are represented by the music.I am very happy to have bought this CD."
Negative	Not worth the money: The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song.Spend your money on something else or buy a whole cd of sting, not justy one song.You will be glad you did.
Positive	Great Game for Young Kids: My kids ages 5 (boy) and 8 (girl) love this game! They are obsessed... It is the one that has been able to keep their attention more than any other so far.
Negative	It didn't work.: It didn't work. I was excited that it came in fast. but the game does not work. it made my kids sad. Waste of money. I do not recommend buying this game. First time it happened to me. Good luck if you decide to buy it.
Negative	Amazon duped. Me too.: This game can NOT be played on the Xbox system that is sold in the stores today!! Maybe I should have known that, but I didn't. I feel as thought sellers should have pointed this out in their ad.My son has an older Xbox, and I am currently waiting for him to get that out of storage to see if the game will play there. Until then, my rating of the transaction is that it was the worst for me ever on Amazon.com, but that may change to an OK.
Negative	Pac Man World 2: I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it
Positive	"Jane Fonda in ""Julia"": I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave shine in their roles in this excellent film based on Lillian Hellman's true life experience during war time. Fonda is at her best in this film playing Lillian Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave won an Academy Award for her performance as Julia. It is a movie not to be missed by serious film buffs."
Negative	Be aware!: This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
Negative	Julia: I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not.
Negative	I don't understand all the hype over this: Another case of when I side with the minority. I didn't get through it. Decided I had much better ways to spend my time. The only thing I really enjoyed was Meryl Streep's bit. I don't whether she resurfaced later in the film but I guess I'll never know now.
Positive	"Compelling, wonderful film: I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."
Positive	What happened to this DVD?: The date says January 1, 2010. Anyone know what happened to prevent this from coming out today, June 7, 2005, as originally planned?
Positive	Continuing enjoyment through the years: This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD.
Negative	fun at first but will get boring: only the first case is fun and the rest are stupid. dont waste your money on this game like i did
Positive	"Wow.: This collection of short stories is destined to be a classic and a ""must-have"" for people everywhere. Take a look at yourself and at your fellow man. This book is great from cover to cover."
Negative	I like the idea, BUT...: As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it.
Negative	yoga for surfers: don't waste your money .lots of wasted time talking about how great yoga is.content is good but alot of fast fowarding.not useful as a work out video.
Negative	Dont buy: This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
Positive	Wow!: Yoga For Surfers is one of the best DVDs I own! I am convinced it is by far, the best yoga tape. Even as a beginner, I can see how it has helped me become more flexible and with such amazing surfing and how radiant Peggy is on-screen, I can't help but get inspired every time I watch it!
Positive	Amazing!: For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it.
Negative	Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place.
Positive	Great DVD: This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.Works great before my surf sessions. I just hope to be able to do the poses all the way soon. It's a great way to start my day.
Negative	Yoga For Sufers Review: As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice.
Negative	Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class.
Positive	I Love this Video: I love this video -- everything about it is so true. Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses. The music is enchanting and adds to the uplifting nature of the program. And the quality of this video is the best I have ever seen - gorgeous surf and beach scenes and top-notch editing between the poses. I recommend this video to everyone!
Negative	Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying.
Negative	"PLEASE READ: This book does NOT contain a book key. I returned one and the next one didnt have it either. The OLC passcode card is nothing either. The card says that ""code is no longer necessary"". Basically this is a like new book with no extra features. Buy used!"
Positive	very helpful: I have found this to be a very helpful workbook to go with Que Tal text. The answers are in the back for self check. It incorporates the vocab of the chapter with the grammar covered.
Positive	"Night Vision: The standard lighting (headlights) on our 2001 Ford Ranger was disappointing. As you get older, you come to appreciate better lighting and the factory headlamps are poor. I tried the better bulbs from NAPA without a great improvement. Finally, I ordered the PIAA's and they represent a great improvement; they seem like twice the illumination of standard lighting. I only wish they were available in""off road"" strength."
Positive	Bright white: Installed these on my 2001 F-150 WOW a Big difference even in big city lights night driving, these bulbs really perform well.
Positive	xtreme white plus bulbs: the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
Negative	Save your money: These are not as bright as the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra and cost a whole lot more. They do not perform as advertised.
Positive	I like em!: Put a set of PIAA headlamps on my Ford Ranger and woke up the night! Not too bright as to annoy on coming traffic but waaay better than the stock lights.Big Jim Miller
Negative	Not enough bag for the buck: I have 2 2005 Dodge pickups the factory headlights suck, I bought a pair of these for one of the trucks. I have to say they are brighter then the factory bulbs. The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs.
Negative	Disappointed: With the cost of these bulbs I was expecting a WOW when I turned them on, but only got a very slight improvement from the previous bulbs. Maybe it's because their in an old Dodge Intrepid which are know to have poor light design. But I was really hoping for an improvement. I run them on high beam all the time just to be able to see at night, and no one has ever flash their lights at me.
Negative	PIAA are whiter: There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn't to impressed. After driving with them I could notice an improvement over regular lamps.
Positive	"An Essential For CD Mixer's!!: This double volume CD is a great tool for the begginer and experts DJ who mixes CDs. Since CD mixing is still fairly modern it is hard to find good loops, beats, scratches, and effects. Simmon Harris has put together a wide range of beats for DJ's to use. Each track includes the BPM (beats per minute), a very helpfull feature that you won't find too often. The price may seem steep at first glance, yet when you realize the use you will get out of this great tool it is worth it. ""Once you use it, you will never put it away"""
Positive	awsume: i got this just it time to winterize our camper its better than draining all the water and replacing with anti freeze.. used it to blow out all water then just poured a little down the drains.. good price and shipping was fast..
Positive	Rugged!: Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.
Positive	This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure. That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex. This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.
Negative	"Too Restrictive to allow air volume needed.: Plug has a tiny hole that is too restrictive to allow enough air volume through to do an adequate job. Hole may be small to attempt ""reduce"" pressure but that is not a satisfactory way to reduce pressure anyway. Need to reduce pressure on compressor regulator to avoid blowing out lines in RV Make you own adapter using a piece of garden hose, and the appropriate adapters to do a satisfactory job of removing all water from you RV lines for winter storage."
Positive	A great book with lots of room for improvements.: I have experiences in many martial arts and had done lots of streetfighting, and I can tell a working technique just by looking at pictures. In this sense, I must say that 75% of Prof. Kirby's moves works well. His armlocks, for example, are more effective than those of Aikido. However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books.
Negative	"Impractical: The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's, or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy, maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art, this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests, but not for serious self-defense.In fact, this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you're a student of the author, of course. I'd hate to see what the ""Basic"" book is like, and as funny as this particular book is, it's not worth the money to buy it, even for a good laugh."
Positive	First Knight: The legend of King Arthur finds new meaning in this powerful romantic novel. When Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, finds herself desperate for protection for both herself and her people from an ex-Knight of the Round Table, she turns to King Arthur to save them all.Guinevere's decision - to marry the king, leads her into danger and intrigue as she begins the wildest journey of her life.When Lancelot saves an unknown lady in the forest, both their hearts become engaged. Lancelot becomes a friend and trusted confidant to the King, and Guinevere becomes Arthur's wife. While fighting to keep their love at bay, war threatens to tear them apart forever.Chadwick's love of re-enactment becomes apparent in this wonderful story of forbidden love. She describes everything in such striking detail; the reader can almost smell the stench of burning straw or feel the adrenaline and fear accompanying battle. This book is a must read, though not quite as powerful as many of Chadwick's other novels.
Positive	First Knight (Cassette): Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again.
Positive	One of my all time favorite books back in print!: A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up. My mom, an elementary school teacher, used to read it to her class every year. I have since purchased two used paperback versions of the book for my grandchildren, and I'm so happy to see it is being reprinted. I highly recommend this book for adults and children. It's a one-evening read for an adult, but I promise you will enjoy it.
Negative	Biography of a Grissly by Seton: I didn't realize that there was no illustrations in the book and Seton was a very fine illustrator, so why would you publish one of his books without the illustrations?
Negative	Ray Charles early years: I am very disappointed with this CD set. I hardly recognize the sound on many songs. My favorite is Georgia on My Mind. I never heard a rendition like the one in this set. It is terrible. I am sorry I made this purchase.
Negative	Quality surprisingly bad: I am really disappointed with the quality of this 2 CD set. Plus, I wasn't able to find a track list anywhere, and I was missing a LOT of songs I was looking forward to having.
Positive	"A tribute to the abilities of the WWII small carrier.: A ""must read"" for anyone interested in the WWII carrier navy, R.Adm. Gallery relates the tedium of service in Iceland, the terror of being stalked by German U-boats in the North Atlantic, capped off with the true-adventure tale of his Carrier Task Group's *capture* of the German U-boat 505 (now on display in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry) off the African coast. D.V. Gallery intersperses writing fit for an adventure novel with the facts of history from the ""big seat"" aboard the USS Guadalcanal - one of the ""baby flat-tops"" of the Second World War (probably the single most underrated warship of that war)"
Positive	"Salty, irreverent, highly amusing: Clear the Decks!""Salty, irreverent, highly amusing"" -- New York Times""One of the best adventure tales of the war."" -- Time Magazine""A book you don't want to put down once you start reading it."" -- Our Navy""Clear The Decks... has an authentic, briny tang to it. And the climax, the tale of Admiral Gallery's brilliant capture of a German U-Boat, is breath-taking.... Anyone who wants to know the real reason why our Navy wins wars ought to read this book."" -- Herman Wouk""As an action-packed account of a baby flattop's campaign against U-boats in World War II, this is a corker. The author writes with warmth, understanding, clarity and rough humor."" -- St. Louis Post Dispatch""A good deal more than a series of belly-laughs."" -- BOMC News""You do not need to be a lover of the sea to enjoy this splendid and humorous."" -- Columbus Dispatch""A RIP-SNORTING ACCOUNT!"" -- Los Angles Mirror"
Positive	A real-life lesson in leadership: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book.
Negative	These are NOT the ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!!: Don't make the same mistake I did!!! First of all, there are only 6 discs, NOT the 7 discslisted! And, if you are interested in quality - meaning you'd like to hear these songs sung by the actual people who made them famous - then DON'T buy this product!!!
Negative	great american spice company: stay away from Great American Spice company. They don't answer their 888 number, local number or emails. They have been investigated by their state attorney general for not shipping items. They settled.If they don't care about their customers ask yourself why should you buy from them.
Negative	WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!: This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!
Positive	"I find that Jeff Gold music is exceedingly uplifting!!: I own two CD's by Jeff Gold: ""Escapes"", and ""The Soul of the Mountain"". I find that his music is exceedingly uplifting, and after listening to his music colors seem to brighten and the belief in goodness is restored. (I especially enjoyed his compositions, ""Del Playa"" and ""The Soul of the Mountain"".) J.Gold is a gifted composer by any standard and he is unparalleled when it comes to writing music that has a healing effect on the psyche. I highly recommend Jeff Gold Music to Everyone!"
Positive	Dr. Barnett's newest edition to a timeless classic: In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A. Barnett gives us this enlightened book to show us step by step the way that we can turn the key and free ourselves through the use of analytical hypnotherapy. The chapter on self hypnosis has taught me great relaxation skills. I have been a fan of this book for over 15 years and find it as relative today as it was when it was first published. This newest version comes with a wonderful new cover design and clean crisp text. Wonderfully written to be easily understood by both the student of hypnosis and the average reader. Well worth the asking price.
Negative	OMG!!!: One of the top 10 worst books ever. Waded through 100 pages and decided life is way too short to waste it reading this gibberish. AVOID!!!!!
Positive	You'll ease your stress if you use the advice in this book: Jim and John have a wonderful way of making you feel like you're sitting down at your kitchen table with a bankruptcy attorney who only has your best interests at heart. They don't pull any punches, and sometimes what they tell you isn't what you really want to hear, but you know they're giving you solid advice. Your anxiety level will plummet if you are thinking of filing bankruptcy and are looking for someone to hold your hand through the process.Paula Langguth Ryan, Author, Bounce Back From Bankruptcy, 3rd Edition
Positive	"I think that its a good book: Anthony's works are all easy to read and the world of xanth draws you in automatically; I guess its the bookworm's equivalent of junk food--not nourishing for your literary education but satisfying nothenless. This book was one of the ""better"" books of Xanth--although i have yet to find one that didn't leave me rolling on the floor and lauging. Its fun reading about a barbarian...they aren't the typical main chracter after all and its interesting how Piers Anthony manages to make something fearsome seem silly and human."
Negative	One of those addicting Xanth novels.: Once you start reading Xanth novels, they become addicting. This one is not as addicting as some of the series
Negative	What were they thinking?: Seriously, I am quite the fantasy reader. However, this piece of dribble should not have ever been published. It is one of the WORST books I have ever read- in any genre. No plot or charecter development, nothing. If you want good fantasy, go read one of the DRAGONLANCE titles.
Negative	Noddy Songs from Toyland: The CD cover shows the 'performer as Noddy'. However, the songs are sung by various artists. They liked the songs, but my grandchildren were disappointed. They thought they would hear the voices heard on the DVD's.
Positive	ORDOR GONE: This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it.
Positive	"Del Shannon Shines: Del Shannon wrote some of the most distributing and depressing songs in rock music. The eerie landscapes and sounds of songs like the classic ""Runaway"", ""Hats Off to Larry"", ""Keep Searchin' (Follow the Sun)"", ""Little Town Flirt"" & ""Stranger In Town"" speak of true heartache and despair. The sound that Mr. Shannon created was original and nothing before or since has quite matched the moodiness of these songs."
Negative	Read as fiction: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
Positive	Worked Great.: I had bought this some time ago, but never used it. Recently I had been having memory card errors on my Canon Camera. I decided to try the 4 in 1 cleaner and it solved my error problems
Positive	Great little tool: I bought this because of errors on my Nikon camera to see if cleaning the contacts for the compact flash card would correct the issue. One cleaning and the errors are going. I'm going to use this to make sure all my cards are getting a clean contact with the device they're in. Pretty great fix if it prevents the need to send the device in to the manufacturer.
Negative	"A great idea, but...: I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection. It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy. Unfortunately, the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB ""A"" cable end - which is what I really needed. If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that, but not the adapters themselves."
Negative	"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.: This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
Negative	It could be better: Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all.
Positive	An unbiased history: One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.
Negative	Check the facts: I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association.
Negative	Not real history: This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. He has admited in interviews that he is not really an historian, but is rather a writer with research assistants and relies mostly on secondary sources. Useful only to those who know not where else to go. Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold.
Positive	"Lovely Like The Moon: Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon. I feel the same way about the music of Jennifer Warnes. I'm glad to know it's there. Jennifer and her beautiful voice has been such an inspiration to me over the years. I am truly glad that this collection includes her early work. Jennifer's music will stand the test of time, i.e. 20 or 30 years from now people will still be listening to the music of Jennifer Warnes. But you don't have to wait that long. Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song ""all we have is here and now"". So buy it!"
Positive	Vintage Warnes: A wonderful collection depicting Jennifer's unique talent from early on through her later years! It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Extremely glad I made this purchase!
Positive	Essential: This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
Positive	Excellent Recording Artist: Jennifer Warnes has always been a great recording artist and has made some fantastic titles songs for some of the greatest films in the past. She is timeless and this album is a great example of that.
Negative	"OOPS.... That isn't Jennifer singing on track 18!: The duet with Steve Gillette ( track 18) is actually a recording of another friend of Steve Gillette's, not Jennifer Warnes . How tacky! How could RAVEN have missed that? I had to adjust the volume knob about five or six times. There is an odd ""wow"" falloff at the end of ""These Days"". Sounds like the engineer stopped the turntable manually.Jennifer Warnes was obviously not involved in the creation of this compilation. Too uneven, badly mastered."
Positive	"This ""Review"" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?"
Positive	"Great Show - I was there!: Great DVD! I waited 6 hours for front row seats general admission. It was worth the wait. A very HOT show. Not only was Warhol there, but some of the members of the 80's band the Go-Go's, and Adam Ant.In the last song ""Rock & Roll"", they do a 10 second close up of me in the audience playing air guitar. My 15 minutes of fame!Lou is the grandfather of Punk and a classic Rock & Roll ICON. But this disk & enjoy."
Negative	sad: a long time lou reed fan was so looking forward to recieving this dvd. if you are entrenched into the talent and feeling and soul of the lou reed album rocknroll animal, you will be so disapointed with this dvd. sweet jane and rocknroll i swear could be played better by a holiday inn cover band. save your money.
Positive	This cd is absolutely awesome. Steiner at his best.: I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well.
Positive	"Great Early Dixie Chicks Single!: ""Goodbye Earl"" was the single that opened my eyes for the Dixie Chicks. This single taken from their first album ""Wide Open Spaces"" is much more ""country"" than ""Earl"", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your ""troubles"" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.""Am I the Only One"" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of ""There's Your Trouble"" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is."
Positive	Monster memories: Good Copy of orginal score.The Wolfman is the stronger of the tracks here though Son of Frankenstein is not in the same class as the music from The Bride of Frankenstein is still invokes great moments from the movie.Great for collectors even if they are not horror fans.The Wolfman tracks from the film are the first to be recorded and also includes music that was wrote but never used in the finished movie.Listening to the music from the DVD realeases of the films, you would find it hard pressed to tell the difference if any.
Positive	A Great Find!: It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on. A true must-have addition for the classic horror collector!
Positive	"IT ""s GREAT ( realy): hey i love it but im an old horror movie fan , if you lov the clissic horrors you'll lov this , it realy is great , i love it ,"
Positive	"Examining the Myths: I felt like cheering most of the time as I read this book. Ms. Venker writes so articulately regarding many of the thoughts I have had as a mother, but didn't know how to express. She is thoughtful in her comments and very honest. She doesn't portray motherhood as being totally blissful, but does express the importance of actually parenting your children once you decide to have them. She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices. We need to make sure that our children's needs are our first priority as we make our choices. We can ""have it all"", but maybe not all at the same time. Thank you, Suzanne, for saying what we all need to hear!"
Negative	Just because she couldn't do it: Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone.
Negative	sad state of affairs: Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH.
Negative	"Where's ""The Myth of Working Fathers""?: The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not ""real"" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not ""real"" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home."
Negative	Misguided author: The author is attempting to justify her own choices by putting down working mothers. Do yourself a favor and don't order this book!!
Negative	Ideological rant: This book is meant to make working mothers feel guilty while glorifying the stay-at-home mom. Numerous academic studies disprove their thesis--studies that the authors choose to ignore. Read this if you want to reinforce your pre-existing world view. Otherwise, don't bother. There's little factual basis to what they say.
Negative	Piece of garbage!: The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else!
Negative	What a stupid book!: Don't waste your money on this book unless you want to be insulted. Just because women work does not mean they can't be great moms. Finding quality daycare is key! My children loved their daycare providers and they loved playing with other kids. I like working and being a mom! I think I'm pretty good at it too!
Negative	Leaks: If your drive thru mud and rain expect water to get in this bag. It is not very water resistant.
Positive	I love this product: I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. The important feature are pronounciation and quickfind. Just by mouse over the word you can find out the meaning.
Negative	"Disappointing book. Not what I expected......: Just another book with huge text and lots of wasted space (that makes you think you are getting a lot of reading material).Unfortunately, not much info in this book. If you are looking for a simple, down-to-earth useful book, this really isn't it.Perhaps the other book I ordered, ""Healing Secrets of the Native Americans: Herbs, Remedies, and Practices That Restore the Body, Refresh the Mind, and Rebuild the Spirit"" [Hardcover] will have more useful info. If it ever gets here that is :(My verdict? ""Secrets of Native American Herbal Remedies: comph GT Native amern Tradition Using Herbs Mind/Body/Spirit Connection for ipvg (Healing Arts)"" [Paperback] is a complete waste of money."
Positive	GREAT BOOK: Great book very interesting, glad I bought it, and for the rest of the books I've bought, just glancing thru them, they're great, love them all, a couple I have to order more because my daughter loved them and took them home with her....
Negative	Failed expectations: I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America
Positive	Bought this as a gift and they are very pleased with it: I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
Positive	Great scary read, would be a good movie....: Masterton has done it again. This book surprised me and also scared the hell out of me at times. People in the reviews are complaining about this book being a rip off of other books...give me a break. This has a HP Lovecraft twist but in a Masterton way! He brings out the FLAVOR of it all. the ending was a disappointment with what the character does, but hey, that is life in the real world. If you enjoy a really creepy haunting tale, this one is for you....
Positive	A pretty damn good blood drenched read: PREY isn't Mastertons best, but is entertaining enough. It's in keeping with his usual blend of intelegent horror and all out gore. I loved the book, and read it in next to no time, I dont usually read books twice, but I did this time. OVERVIEW: Intelegent. Bloody. And a great cast.Masterton has again come up with a winner, a page turner. A gore fest that will satisfy even the most thirsty of Horror fans. Pick up a copy, you wont regret it.Nice One Graham.... (Keep writing em.)
Negative	Should characters have brains?: When I first started to read this book, I recognized right away a lot of potential in the story. All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1.
Negative	"HPL would be spinning: This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's ""Dreams in the Witch House.""It's not a good Masterton book, either. The last 30 pages seem as if he had to get it done fast, or be sued by the publisher.Skip it. ""Spirit"" is a lot better."
Negative	Started well, then...: turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book.
Positive	IT IS A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CANNOT BE SCARED.: A HORROR BOOK CANNOT GET BETTER THAN THIS;G.M HAS A WAY WITH WORDS TO SCARE THE BEJEE'S OUT OF YOU. HIS STYLE , PROSE AND CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS REFRESHING , ENTERTAINING AND NEVER LACKS TO GRASP YOUR ATTENTION AND INTREST. ANY LADIES THINKING G.M IS A GREAT AUTHOR WRITE TO ME VIA E-MAIL.
Positive	Pretty: I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.
Positive	"KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!: Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
Positive	"Yield, America!: Long you have resisted to Kylie, longer than anyone else on the Planet, but the rocking Krafterwerkish ""La, la, la, la"" will sneak behind you and get into your head. It's shall indeed make all the world move. It just must, it is so damn good. Enjoy Kylie, she's back to make Americans unable to get her out of their heads!!!"
Negative	I'll never understand...: When I first heard this song, I laughed. I thought to myself: Who gave her a record deal, she's just plain bad. Than I read a Teen People Article about how she's been around since the 80's, just not in the U.S. But, it didn't change my opinion. Teen People claimed she's bigger than Madonna in the U.K., why? She can hardly sing, her song is bad, I mean, she's not even pretty.Kylie Minogue, is an insult to pop music and a waste of air time on the radio, and that's all.
Positive	Great movie!: This is a classic Mary Kate & Ashley movie. The sisters trade places in order to help their dad win the soccer tournament and to help themselves since one sister likes playing soccer more than the other. Their dad in this movie is played by Eric Lutes, who later again stars as their dad in the short lived series So Little Time.This is a great movie for tween girls, I loved every minute of these MK&A; movies when I was a tween!
Negative	The Olsens' movies are just getting more and more pathetic!: I'm very, very sorry to say this, but THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS. THERE IS NO PLOT, NO MORAL LESSON, NO NOTHING. I can understand the part how Sam and Emma switch teams because they were upset with how they were placed, but after that it was like, hello? Where's the rest of the story? The acting was pretty good but the actual plot (or lack of it) totally stunk!
Positive	Robert Clark and the Olsen twins: I saw this movie and i thought that the twins were really good.But,I really like the way that Robert Clark played Helmet Head.Keep showing more movies with him.
Positive	Really good and even interesting for adult viewing.....: My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!
Positive	"""Switching Goals"" is OK...: It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
Negative	"Too Typical: You think that since these girls had done so many movies, they would have least done something more original than the ""twin"" switch. They would not have been as successful as they are if they were not born twins, but they should still be more creative. I did not like this movie, and the acting was not good at all. It was a huge disappointment."
Positive	HAPPY: the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.
Positive	The Best: As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.
Negative	Pretentious: Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious.
Positive	"I didn't fall asleep. That's a good sign!: Okay, I had to read this book for school. From the description on the back I didn't think that it would be very interesting. I was wrong. It held my attention with it's colorful words and characters and kept me guessing about some characters. Anyway, overall it was a very good book. I only wish that the ending was developed more and wasn't one of those ""use your imagination"" endings."
Positive	Quick read: Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston.
Positive	True Bionic Serum: The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum
Positive	great service: I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again.
Positive	Well worth the price!: This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital.
Positive	Exceptionally good analysis of consumer debt issues: The author helped launch the first credit card in the 1950's. He describes in detail the many bad things that have happened from Americans becoming too reliant on plastic, living beyond their means. Should be required reading for all high school students!!!!
Positive	ladies citizen: My wife loves it. Got it for her as a gift. She says co-workers compliment her on it. I like the eco-drive technology from citizen, its cool that you dont have to ever worry about a battery. As for keeping time.. this is dead on, just like my Eco-drive.
Positive	I Love this watch thanks amazon !: This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.
Negative	Buyer BEWARE: This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase
Negative	There's gold in that there cave: A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents.
Positive	"Unforgettable: ""I hope this book will never be read."" So begins Yourcenar's Fires...a richly dense collection of famous myths and legends stunningly revitalized through the voices and eyes of the heroines. Intertwining the stories are excerpts from Yournenar's own journal taken from the time during which she had written the stories. Achingly familiar to anyone recovering from a broken heart, Yourcenar marries the heartache of this century's woman to women throughout the ages."
Positive	stories of the spirit: this is a beautiful book. the one i had for years got compromised by the mold damage we had in our old home so had to be thrown out. since this was one of my favourite books -- of course i had to get another one.
Positive	Excellent sound: The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it.
Positive	"I own one and I want another!!!: I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Now they are out of stock and I can't find one. For the price, this product delivers fine sound. I agree with some previous reviewers on the issue of the battery, but that is a minor point. I love the sound!!! It also has good radio reception for stations that are at the fringe of the FM reception band. I did not buy it as a clock radio, but as a less expensive alternative to Bose. At $400 less than the comparable Bose, I say ""go for it'! I hope it is available soon."
Negative	Definitive of what?: A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work.
Negative	"How could this happen.....: Jefferson Starship at the time(1983)had released 3 outstanding albums, Freedom at Point Zero, Modern Times, Wind of Change. If anyone had the opportunity to see the band with drummer Ansley Dunbar, You know how disappointing this video is. Unfortunately, when listening to songs like ""Stranger"" you could hear the bands new drummer(???)the mistakes and missed drum fills. It's a shame that the band never released any Video performance of the band with Dunbar. It's a good mix of song selection. Too bad they didnt fine tune the playing.(Why didnt they play ""Save Your Love"" ""Lightening Rose"" ""RockMusic"")"
Negative	This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha
Negative	A classic book sold by weight not content: Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example: p50. Q6. Which of the following acids are polyprotic? Acetic; Sulphuric; Hypochlorous; Nitric; all of the above. Answer: Carbonic! PLEASE! Chemistry is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse.
Negative	Most horrendous test prep book in press...: Amazon should offer negative star ratings, because one star is far too glamorous a prize for this untrustworthy and erroneous book. I am shocked at the simple lack in proofreading the text, question, and answers. Students of Chem should never buy this book, and those that have should write the publisher and demand a refund. The only good use for this text would be as camp fire fuel.
Negative	This book is a Travesty: With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better book than this in my sleep. What did the authro get her Ph.D in anyway? Was it sociology, or perhaps basket weaving? I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?
Negative	Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks.
Negative	sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort.
Negative	Wish I could give zero stars: Avoid this book at all costs. It contains numerous errors, misleading items, and misspellings. In the example problems, many of the answers are worked out to find something other than what the original question asked (i.e. oxidation state instead of coordination number). I suggest the author, Monique Laberge, allow someone else to write the next edition.
Negative	nothing but errors in this book: I agree completely with the other reviews of this book. I just spent an hour deriving and re-deriving the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The previous review tells me what I need to know -- it is incorrect in this book!!! There are so many errors that it is actually more work to review material that I already know than it was to learn it the first time. It's a shame I can't give zero stars on this review.
Negative	I could have written a better book myself: The author's alleged PhD is quite polemical. I think it averaged an error per page or so. For the 15 minutes I glanced it over, I think I became dumber.
Negative	Monkies on typewriters: You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes.
Negative	Not so good: I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers.
Negative	This book is the worst you could use for your GRE prep: This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it.
Positive	"New to collecting? This will help.: Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the ""Exploration and Travel"" chapter instead of the ""Tobbaco"" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."
Positive	Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference...: This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!
Positive	Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards. Information is given on the history of the cards as well as many examples. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in collecting or just want to know more about Victorian cards.
Positive	AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana
Negative	"sloppy: I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""
Negative	Consider American Made Products: Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American.
Negative	Knock off: This is just a knock off of crocodile dentist. It comes from China, and was already broken. The package was so beat up, I couldn't even give it as a gift. Also, it doesn't work. It just snaps every 2nd tooth, and sometimes the teeth don't pop up. This is a very small version as well, the description doesn't tell you it's travel size.
Negative	Item seemed like it was used not a new product!: Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
Negative	"Cheaply made: I bought this for my son after remembering when I played it when I was younger. I looked at tons of different ones to see which one I should get. I bought this one and it came broken. I tried to fix it but even after it should've worked again, it would still let you put all the teeth down without the crocodile biting. This one is also very small. I went to Toys R Us and bought the one they sell, which I was nervous to do since you couldn't see what's inside the box, but that one is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, plus it doesn't actually ""bite"" so my little ones won't be too afraid to play it."
Negative	"do not waste your money: i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."
Negative	Broken right out of the box: I wasn't expecting much, but was disappointed that this game didn't even survive shipping. It didn't work right out of the box. The mouth won't close as it should (which is the whole point of the game). I'm a speech therapist and thought this would be a cute game for my students, but it's going back as it's a piece of junk.
Negative	Knock Off: I am upset to see that this is a knock off. How is it legal for them to sell this? I guess amazon does not care to protect it's buyers...
Negative	"crap: This toy came in poor shape - the plastic was broken and it was dirty - suppose to be ""new"" - It has not even been one month and the toy is brok"
Positive	"Great for young kids: I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."
Positive	Fun toy!: I got this for my 4 yr old for Christmas. I thought it would be bigger then it is so it ended up being a stocking stuffer but it is still super fun. It ended up being a good size because we can put it in a backpack to take on trips or to the doctors office to him occupied. The best part of the game is the anticipation on when it is going to snap closed adds to the excitement. The only down side is the head will snap off if it's opened too hard which happen with a 4 yr old sometimes but it's easy to put back on.
Negative	pinches fingers: My son got this last year for his fourth birthday. He only played it a few times when it slammed down and somehow pinched his fingers hard enough to make him cry. He never wanted to play the game again, I ended up getting rid of it. There are too many other fun and safe games out there to bother with this one.
Negative	horrible!: this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it.
Negative	very small and lasted about 1 hour: I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)
Positive	Cheap, fun toy: This is a fun toy and better than I expected. It is not very durable and sometimes the teeth stick down, but overall it is enjoyable. My older daughter loves to play with me, but it is even easy enough for my 1yr old to play too. It's also small enough for the younger one to hold. Their surprise when the mouth snaps shut is adorable.
Positive	"Cute but overpriced: I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."
Positive	I love this toy!: I am a Speech Therapist and this is a toy that the children with whom I work (3,4, and 5 year olds) ask for over and over again. They just love it! I have the small travel one which is perfect since I travel all around for my job. If the child is too afraid to push the teeth down I give him/her a tongue depressor or my pencil so the crocodile bites that instead of the child.
Negative	Not what I expected: When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game.
Negative	Not as durable as I thought it would be.: The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way.
Positive	"quick reflexes!: I've used this game with kids of all ages, including children with special needs. It's a good idea to demo the game first to show them what happens (and the unpredictability). Kids that have issues getting their finger ""bitten"" can use a pencil or popsicle stick to press down the teeth. The end result is always lots of laughs. On the adult front, it could be a good drinking game :)"
Negative	Fun, but fragile: My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again.
Negative	"Just OK: I guess it's my own fault for not really reading the description, but this thing is TINY. Was fun enough but the kids (3 & 4) figured out which tooth was the ""bad"" one after @ 30 seconds of playing with it. Not worth the money."
Positive	Cute!: Bought this for my 3 yr old boy, but my 6 yr old boy likes playin with it too. My younger boy is a little afraid of the mouth snapping shut but still likes to play with it. They did figure out that the tooth that causes the mouth to close is harder to push so its easy to cheat. So we made a rule that once you touch it, you gotta push it! :) I would recommend this toy, its fun.
Negative	broken in days: I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!
Positive	Great for playdates, but a bit fragile: We are on our third crocodile dentist! It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE. But I carry it to the park in a large toy bag and the past two copies have broken...when you press a tooth it won't stay down anymore. A good way around this might be to keep it in a box of it's own.This is also a wonderful toy for parents following the RDI Steve Gutstein social therapy for children with Autism. Because this toy has an element of surprise, as you press each tooth you never know if this is the tooth that will cause the jaw to snap shut! Note: the snapping shut is fairly gentle and safe for preschoolers!
Negative	Piece of junk: It broke, I swear, the second time my child touched the teeth. I have never seen a toy do that. Maybe I just got a lemon.
Negative	Travel Sized --- Not what I expected: So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result.
Negative	Doesn't work! Cheaply made.: Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.
Negative	WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY: I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
Positive	Fun for Tots and Preschoolers: We just got this for our 2 1/2 year old and 4 1/2 year old. They love it. The 2 year old is a little scared but he will play sometimes and he really likes to watch. The 4 year old loves it, especially if you make your reaction to the gater bites dramatic.
Negative	Doesn't work: I bought this game for my children at Christmas and it didn't work from the second we pulled it from the package. The teeth get stuck and the mouth doesn't close most of the time. I didn't return it because it would cost more to deal with than I paid for it. Maybe I just got a bad one, who knows. My kids still play with it (they are only 3) but not the way it was meant to be played with. I would recommend just going with the full sized one, not the travel size.
Positive	Great fun, no pieces: I am a dental hygientist and this toy is the hit with kids from 2 thru 15!! I give it 5 stars, somehow it found its way home with a patient and now I am so glad I found it again.
Positive	Cheap, Entertaining Toy for Preschoolers: I bought this when my twins were 3 1/2. It was a cheap item, there are no pieces to lose, and it's simple enough that the girls can play together. If they want you to play with them, the game is very quick. The top jaw has fallen off a few times but I think this was my girls' fault - too rough with it - and each time, I've snapped it back on.
Positive	Fun but short lived: I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!
Negative	Travel Toy: I was VERY disappointed with this toy. This is not a full size toy but rather a travel toy. I could not believe how small this was for the price I paid (around $13.00). I will be checking to see what the return policy is on this item. I would NOT recommend if you are looking for an actual game for more than one child to play.
Positive	Fragile: This toy broke within the first two minutes that I took it out of the box. My son is 4 years old and has had most of his toys for a long time and is not particulary destructive, so I was surprised after reading all the reviews for it- how great it was-- you could imagine my disapointment. I do not give this toy a favorble reccomendation.
Negative	Crocodile Doom: The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little.
Negative	"May not appeal to toddler: My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
Negative	Broken right out of the box: At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
Negative	Cheap Plastic: This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
Negative	"Instantly broke: We had a larger ""Crocodile dentist"" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. After a month or two the toy broke so you couldn't play the game. I bought this as replacement. It is very small and the game never worked - you push all of the teeth and the mouth never shuts. It's a shame because the concept of this game is great. But don't buy this one"
Negative	Very small, flimsy and not working properly: Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same.
Negative	disappointed: We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Very poorly made. Would buy if I could find a better quality product becasue the game itself is quite funny.
Negative	Not enough info: The description didn't say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Doesn't work that great, either.
Negative	Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
Negative	Horrible Quality: This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking.
Negative	doesn't live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back.
Negative	piece of junk: We played this game twice and it broke. The teeth won't come back up and the mouth won't stay open. Save your money.
Negative	This Toy is JUNK!!!: I bought this toy for my Grandson for Christmas, because he asked for it. I was looking for the original Crocodile Dentist game by Milton Bradley, but they are few and far between and expensive. So I got this this. When it arrived I was shocked by how small it was and how cheap it looked!! On Christmas day my Daughter called me and said the thing did NOT work. The teeth would go down, and never come back up!!! So it is as cheap as it looks. This thing is going back, and I would NOT recommend this to anybody!!!! IT IS JUNK!!!! Bring back the original Milton Bradley game!!!!
Negative	Cute Concept, broke within 5 minutes: I purchased this toy for my 3 year old nephew, who absolutely loves crocodiles. I personally opened it and played with him. Half of the teeth went down and never came back up. The head never even snapped down. I wouldn't recommend this toy, as cute as it looks.
Negative	fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing.
Negative	cute idea, but not worth it, save your money: Cute idea, but toy is cheaply made and doesn't work most of the time. Not worth it, save your money.
Positive	Silly Stupid Fun!: We bought this as a clearance item for a lot cheaper than what it's selling for on Amazon. This toy has been dropped, sat on, stepped on, etc. In other words, it survived a toddler and a little boy. It's so stupid it's fun. We've had a great time with it.
Negative	Not what I was hoping for...: This simple game works exactly as stated: players take turns pushing the teeth in until the jaw snaps shut. However, I was disappointed at how small and cheap this game is. It's about as large as an adult's hand and seems like it could break very easily. I would've felt better about this size and quality level if it would have cost about half the amount I paid.
Negative	Boring...: the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust.
Positive	*: Played game with 4 year old students- they loved it. It kept them guessing and were surprised every time.
Positive	Exciting Kid Toy: I could sense the heart pumping excitement builds up every time my 4 year old play this game. He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic. This is a great toy in a dentist's waiting area.
Negative	Scary: I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years
Negative	Disappointed: I was disappointed in this toy. It was a travel size and I was expecting a bigger size. I had seen the larger version and was really looking forward to giving it to my daughter. As is turns out, she was a little scared of it anyway, so she probably would have really been scared of the larger one. Anyway, it is a great toy, but I would prefer the larger version.
Negative	Disapointed: WARNING! THIS IS NOT THE CROCODILE DENTIST GAME THAT YOU GREW UP WITH! I had the idea to buy Crocodile Dentist for a Christmas present for a five year old boy. I remember playing the game when I was younger and I loved it! (the original toy has teeth that you pull out of the croc's mouth and the crocodile was atleast 3 times larger then this pewny little thing). Not only did they change how you play the game, but the size as well...what a jip...shame on them!
Negative	Horrible: My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas.
Negative	Crocodile Dentist: It started out being fun, but was too hurtful to little fingers. It's not being played with as much as I thought it would, but it was what they asked for. Another toy for the garage sale.
Positive	cute toy: Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
Negative	This was the worst toy I have ever purchased: This was awful. I guess you get what you pay for!!!!! When we opened for the grand daughters to pay with Christmas Eve, the teeth was sticking and there was no excitement. I was suppose to snap it did nothing.
Negative	Disappointed: My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (books about going to the dentist, the books Open Wide and Dr. DeSoto, ...) so we were really hoping this toy would get his attention too. However, it is just not very entertaining and it is also very fragile. The teeth would get stuck from the first day we opened it and after dropping it a couple of times, it broke apart, so we are no longer able to use it anyway.Unfortunately, this toy was a dud at our home.
Positive	Best game of all time: If you are looking for something fun for any age, look no further. You simply must play it, you will be as addicted as we are.
Negative	Purchased twice-never worked: My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
Negative	"awful: I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
Negative	Broke after a week: A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money.
Negative	unhappy: don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money
Positive	crowd pleaser: This is a small game - easy to pack and take anywhere. It is a lot of fun for kids all ages. My 5 year old recieved it at Christmas but it was played all day by kids younger and older. It gets a laugh every time. The jaw came undone once - but was easy to put back together. It's nice to see the kids enjoy such a simple game among all the techie toys they recieved.
Negative	"Don't waste your money: This is a knock off of the real toy. It came in a weird box and the toy was rattling around, not even tied down. It already looked played with. The box had several odd phrases on it like the toy is ""elegant"". What??!! Obviously a foreign knock off - and a cheap one at that!"
Negative	"NOT the Crocodile Dentist you think you're getting. China replica.: I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
Negative	broken when I opened the box: When I opened the box, I pushed down the teeth to see how hard it would clamp shut and it didn't clamp shut. I returned the toy to the company and will not be purchasing another one. I was originally excited about this purchase as I have seen the toy before and the kids really liked it.
Positive	Best Chocolate bar ever: This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
Positive	Cheap and works really well!: Bought a pair of these after reading about a little DIY someone did with the SonySony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and adding a crossover to them. Was an incredibly straight forward install and so far I'm really pleased with the noticeably richer sound I'm getting. I'm a college student on a budget which is why I went with the Sony's in the first place but these cross overs definitely stayed in budget and were worth the purchase.I was contemplating making my own cross over but gave in to the simplicity.Also wanted to note that these shipped very quickly, arrived 3 days after ordering and they made a very far journey.
Negative	Beautiful music, lousy packaging: I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing. There are no liner notes, no timings and no indication of which composer wrote which piece. As these rarities will be mostly of interest to the more serious collector/listener, this is a major failing.
Positive	"He Had a Great Voice: Matt Monro had a great voice. It's a shame that he never reached greater status in the United States for having such a gift. There are 36 songs on this album and they are all good. His ""From Russia With Love"" vocal from the James Bond film is a classic."
Positive	The Mennonite Hymnal: I collect old hymnals and lived in Mennonite country for a few years. 606 is the Mennonite Doxology. It's an awesome arrangement that is sung so beautifully a capella by the Mennonites. So glad to have my own copy of this!
Negative	Tedious Reds under the beds stuff: Mr Drury's earlier novels are well received (Advise and Consent, particularly). I won't be bothering to read any more after this rather tedious 'The Russian's are coming to get us' effort. We all know now how that turned out. I will say that is slightly more believable than 'Red Dawn', slightly.
Positive	its nice: I was replacing my old cook book & I thought this was the same one but it isn't but it is a nice cook book.
Positive	Best show you've never seen: This is the last good show that MTV ever made. Unfortunately, they only lasted one season; by the time it aired, MTV's audience had become too stupid to keep this show afloat. Suffice to say that the show is excellent, and nonstop laughs. It is very clever, and I have purchased a copy for myself, and continue to purchase more, to give out as gifts for xmas and birthdays.
Positive	"So Sad...: How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show? Leave it to Mtv to can something as great as this in favor of dreck like ""My Super Sweet Sixteen."" They should be ashamed of themselves (well, they should've been ashamed of themselves long before this, but that's besides the point).Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Ghandi & JFK (along with a host of others)... cloned... in high school...Very well-written... great voice casting (Will Forte, Nicole Sullivan, Michael McDonald)... a great show that didn't get a chance, thanks to a once great network that has gone down the pooper."
Positive	"Hilarious!: So many clever references in this show. I love how each historical figure translated into a typical high school persona, but with a twist. It's when you spot cariactures of the ratpack or hear about JFK sleeping with ""Catherine-the-Not-So-Great"" that I get the giggles and end up watching another episode when I thought I could just watch one."
Positive	Greatest animated show ever: This is the best animated series ever. I found it originally on Youtube and fell in love with it. I'm so pissed that it's cancelled. The show is a comedy blendin slapstick and paroding teen dramas. the cast itself is enough to make you laugh. the DVD is in great condition by it and maybe just maybe the show will come back.
Positive	"Amazing: Loved this show eight years ago, still loving it now. It is very tongue in cheek, literally and figuratively. I can't decide if my favorite episode is ""Litter Kills"" or ""Makeover, Makeover, Makeover: The Makeover Episode."" They're both so awesome. Buy it, watch it, love it. It's amazing."
Positive	I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found...: This book saved my grade in Constitutional Law. A week before the final I was so confused and lost in the material and I was freaking out! I bought this book as a last hope at saving my grade, and not only did it save my grade, I got one of the best grades in the class!! This is the BEST supplement I have seen yet that explains and ties everything together. I would recommend it a thousand times over to all law students who need a little (or a lot) of help with Constitutional Law.
Negative	Ultra-bad sound quality: This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!
Positive	Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that...
Positive	Classic Bowie and Ronson: This is one cool but dated video. It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson, deceased, available. It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era. It's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear. It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder.
Positive	glam rock at it's best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog.
Negative	I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible. It must have been wonderful to be at Hammersmith Odeon when this concert was performed, but it sure didn't translate well onto film. Listen to the recordings and skip this disaster.
Positive	"Stardust Memories: If you like all that pre-grunge grunge dressed up in outlandish costumes and enough make-up to cause Angela Bowie blush, you'll David and the Spiders ripping their way through their hits and a couple of covers including Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"" and Lou Reed's ""White Light, White Heat.""Grungy and gaudy before either were cool!"
Negative	"Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
Negative	"Where in the world is the original mix?: I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."
Positive	A nice DVD: I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie.
Negative	disappointing: One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. But, after making all the adjustments I could think of I could not make the sound (or video for that matter) quality acceptable. As much as I adore David Bowie, I haven't even been able to watch this even once all the way through. I did notice that the favorable reviews were for the VHS version of this film. Too bad, such potential!
Negative	Agree with Maltin: I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. Pennebaker obviously had a very low budget, and probably the film sat around for years before he pieced it together in a lame moment. I enjoyed seeing the different costume changes most...
Negative	"You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd...: As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
Negative	"Ziggy stardust & the DVD from the rubbish bin: I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it""s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it."
Positive	Camera work not 100% but great music all the same.: I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful. But you have to consider how difficult it is to film at a live concert in the dark. At some points, the camera does shake and it becomes hard to see Ziggy. However, the music ROCKS! And it is definitely worth buying! I watch it ALL THE TIME!
Positive	The Best Book In The World!!: I have read over 100 books, but none as fabulous as this one. I know, I know, it's just a pony pals book! But this book had real meaning. I don't know why Angela or whoever is complaining about nothing bad ever happing to them, because that was exactly what happened in this book. The Pony Pals go away to a riding clinic. No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!! This book was very touching and helped me realize that ponies are just as good as horses, if not better.
Positive	My nephews love them!: I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don't fight with one another. My only complain is the flashlight, very poor quality. The light keeps going off and on, even with a new battery. I think it's a connection problem. Aside from that... my nephews love them.
Positive	More plastic toys, but they'll have fun...: My 4 yr old is really into hunting so this is perfect for him right now. Yeah, it's more plastic that will eventually break and the binoculars arent anything great but he doesnt know that. I think it will get lots of use especially from his own imagination. Cant beat that!
Negative	"pretty but delicate: this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
Positive	Mystical truth accessible to everyone!: What an awesome book! Author Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism. It was amazing to read the ways so many different people can come to experience the divine.What sets this apart from so many spiritual books is it brings divinity down to earth wihtout losing the divinity!And finally, a spiritual writer who finds a way to be honest and real, herself. Not an ounce of pretension!!!
Positive	Great dada from the Bonzos!: Having heard most of the Bonzos' catalog (or catalogue, if you're in the UK), off of assorted collections and the Cornology boxed set, I leaped at the chance to own the original CD's (and this was the last one I purchased), because of the bonus tracks. As always, Neil Innes provides sharp and witty banter recounting the history of how the Bonzo tracks came into existence, and the music never fails to delight, especially 'The Craig Torso Show' where I would have nearly fell about laughing if I wouldn't have been in the car ('Craig Torso smells wonderfuuuuuuul'). Minus one star for again mis-labelling Sidney Nicholls (aka Big Sid, the guy playing banjo in the numbered group shot) as Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell.
Negative	Beware: I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. It does not say this clearly in the product description
Positive	An Excellent Gift: I was given this book as a Christmas gift by a very good friend. She is American, I'm a Scot and, at first, I wondered why she was sending me a book called Inheriting Scotland. Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance.
Negative	Not as expected: Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one.
Negative	Color is not expresso!: We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!
Positive	Beautiful music: Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. If I had not seen the movie, I would never have heard his compositions. This album would be loved by anyone who is moved by Celtic music. Beautiful!
Positive	The Shipping News: I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound.
Positive	love this movie!: This is a great movie with an excellent cast and a beautiful score. I watch it over and over! Some of the scenes are a little bit gruesome, but they are somewhat necessary for the story.
Positive	Great performance!: This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD. I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc. I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect.
Negative	"Adds very little to the online docu: This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: ""In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)."" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."
Negative	Falls far short of expectations.: The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent.
Negative	Save your money.: Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation.
Negative	This book could have been something special...: It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own.
Negative	Good only for the beginners.: This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself.
Positive	Scott: While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.
Negative	forget it for linux: The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground.
Negative	Stick with the on-line docs: Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken
Negative	All this information is online.: This was the only Tomcat book available at the time I was looking, so I decided to pick it up to enhance my knowledge. However, almost all the information I found in it was available, sometimes verbatim, online.
Negative	"this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects"": If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
Positive	Best book on the subject: (...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource.
Negative	Not nearly enough detail: It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat.
Positive	Great Text.: Finally a text that goes beyond the high school like documentation packaged with Tomcat. I found everything I needed. I especially found value in the Chapters on deploying other Jakarta technologies into the Tomcat container.Great text.
Negative	"Good lord! one of the WORST books out there!: I've read a quite a few technical books and by far, this one tops the list as being THE worst book I've ever read. Too much information missing, makes many assumptions that you know what you're doing. (If I knew what I was doing with Tomcat, why would I need the book?) Unbelievable. HORRIBLE is a word that comes to mind (among many others that would be ""bleeped"" off of here.)"
Negative	Worthless: I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail.
Negative	Incomplete and not thourough: This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today.
Positive	Great Book, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration: I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James.
Negative	too expensive: The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. The only reason I agreed to it was because the store had stopped carrying the item (but is now)
Positive	Great product, worth the nasty taste: It took me a while to get used to the flavor: very bitter. I put it in a little bit of water then wash it down with a whole lot of water, every evening. I notice a huge difference in my sleep, among other things. I highly recommend it!
Negative	Cinematic satire is dead: Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything.
Negative	Yes, this is a lame=weird movie: 1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting.
Negative	God, This Movie's A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie.
Negative	ridiculously overrated campy trash: Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap.
Negative	YYYYAAAAWWWWNNNN: What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I read. I guess I should have read more of them, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie a total bore.I was hoping it would get better, maybe a surprise scene in the middle or the end of the movie but it never happened!That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back.
Negative	Bad, bad, boring, bad: I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie.
Negative	Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust.
Negative	Waste of Money: It was a waste of money. In my opinion, it was just shy of being labeled a porno film.
Positive	GET THE DVD BY ALL MEANS: The DVD has one of the best director's and actor's comments I have ever seen on a DVD.McLellan's performance is beyond positive description (did I spell his name right?).
Positive	"Stunning and brilliant: I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""
Positive	Tender, wonderful movie: I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. Ian McKellan is just wonderful. The scene where he talks about the loss of his friend in WWI is so moving. The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again.
Positive	An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection.
Positive	Ian McKellen shines hauntingly.....: What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !
Positive	"Ian MacKellan was robbed at the Oscars!: He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded movie director James Whale (directed ""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and the 1936 ""Showboat"", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Instead of being turned off by his penchant for young boys, you felt sorry for him. Sir Ian was more worthy of the Best Actor Oscar than Benigni. Also excellent work by Lynne Redgrave and even Brendan Fraser. I would recommend this video to anyone!"
Positive	"Good Movie: Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies. Knew little about ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale, but movie gives much insight."
Positive	Hollywood Queens and then some: A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?
Negative	"Why?: I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."
Negative	Boring,,,: Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man...
Negative	"A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.: First, forget anything about ""Frankenstein."" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled ""God, This Movie's A Monster!""For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."
Positive	Tender, Beautiful, and crack-me-up funny!!: This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
Positive	Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!: This movie has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!
Negative	"I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....: This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying ""who cares?"" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."
Positive	"A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called ""Father of Frankenstein,"" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you."
Positive	More than perfect: This movie is a masterpiece. IMHO, it is flawless in every aspect. Words cannot describe how wonderful these actors are. Ian McKellen has definitely dominated the show. He is like a beautiful centerpiece that is made of diamond. I couldn't move my eyes away from him. And Brendan Fraser is equally good; his strength is not a bit weaker than his counterpart. That is admirable. Finally, Lynn Redgrave, she has shone through the whole movie. She's perfect. The story telling is magically, the director, the screenwriter, the musician; the whole production team has done an incredible work to bring this tragedy story to live. These people are brilliant; they know their stuff; they know life; there is no doubt about that. What amazes me is that they also have a loving heart and that makes this movie extra special.
Positive	"A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent: This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray."
Positive	"good: I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a ""strong type "" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!"
Positive	Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character. She plays it pretty drab inside and out.
Negative	Boring, boring, boring!: Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along.
Positive	Brad Renfro films are always good.: I missed this title when it was in theaters. I have learned to appreciate Brad Renfro. Too bad, like Charlie Sheen, he was hooked on drugs but at a younger age.
Negative	No details = NO sale!: First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash....
Negative	POOR SUPPORT: I purchased this game and it would not work. I contacted the manufacturer(Oxygen) and they asked to send them a diagnostc. I sent this information and never received a response(it has been one week). I contacted them at least ten times, I also called them and left a message without a reply.Subsequenty I learned from my computer manufacturer that this game requires a T & L accelerator card which is not included in laptops and the game will not work on laptop. This information could easily have been suplied by them instead of ignoring my request for support.I will never know if this game is any good or if it will work and I am stuck with it.Buyer Beware!In addition I would like to add that the phone support did eventually get back to me several days later and they tried to assist me but unfortunately the game is not designed for the current laptop but I never received a reply from the on line support
Negative	Not Thrilled: I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. After you hit the ball there is a streak that follows the ball. I found this annoying. I ended up taking it off my computer and found a different game that I like MUCH better. I'm glad I didn't pay a whole lot for this. It was disappointing.
Positive	Perfect For Rainy Day Golfing: As a person who frequents the golf course on a weekly basis, I can confidently say that this game may give real golf a run for its money. This game is a wonderful simulation of real life golf. The graphics and control settings are by far more realistic than any other simulated golf game out there. Unlike many other virtual golf game, Prostroke provides players with the ability to simulate the skills needed when playing a real golf game. I found myself angling my body as well as the club. I was even perfecting my footwork for the perfect shot. The game was great. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't always have time to run down to the golf course or just simply feels like hitting a few rounds from the comfort of their own home.
Negative	don't buy it: it has some nice features and it's too bad that you can't see them. everything is black. the grass is black. the bunkers are black. I can't see anything.
Negative	don't bother: As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests.There are no seatbelt slots. You can cut them in, but you can do that on a flat piece of cloth too. In fact this is actually not much more than a flat piece of cloth. Save the $$ and use an old blanket.
Negative	Disappointed: I should have listened to the first reviewer. It truly was nothing more than a blanket- with no provisions for seat belts or headrests. You could cut them in yourself but you can do that with a blanket and probably have a much easier time of it (cutting into this material and not having it fray would be near impossible). Can't believe it is being sold as a bench seat cover. I sent it back and got the Elegant brand instead from a local parts store. Elegant had the provisions for the seat belts and the head rests. So much happier with that purchase.
Negative	I did not receive the item: I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
Negative	"quite bad: I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."
Positive	Sturdy, nice looking: I've had this outside my kitchen door for a couple of months. It's great at cleaning shoes (I do a lot of gardening and yard work), it's holding up well, and the rubber base is very solid.
Negative	HORRIBLE: I would acttualy give it 0 stars. This book accuses the ming and Qing Emperors as horrible rulers and doesnt mention much about the manchus. it also criticies to much about the Qing Dynasty. Also, the information is OUTDATED/ along woith many words. DO NOT BUY THIS BOKK! DONNT EVEN LOOK AT IT!
Positive	Realistic Tree: This Xmas tree is a very lifelike and realistic tree and is just what we wanted for our living room! The lights on it are beautiful and the pine cones are a great added effect. Can't wait to put the presents underneath!
Positive	Christmas Tree, artificial: The GKI/ Bethlehem Ligh Glacier Christmas Tree is the first artificial tree that looks real and fools most of my guests. We saw the same tree at a well known hardware store for double the price. The tree is easy to assemble and even comes with a DVD that explains how to put tree together. The tree comes adorned with pinecones and snow frosted tips. It looks just like the trees we cut near Placerville, CA. It is our first artificial tree and we love it!
Positive	Great item but very tight fit: This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won't move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal.
Negative	Trading one bad habit for another: Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!
Positive	"This is actually better than the Live From New Haven DVD! 13 extra minutes.: I have the Live From New Haven DVD and wasn't very impressed with the audio and picture quality. This VHS has a better picture quality and it sounded better. Not only that but it had back stage footage AND Pat Benatar performing ""Little Paradise"" as the last encore which wasn't shown on the Live From New Haven DVD/ or that 1998 VHS release. Also included was the video Love Is A Battlefield as it was a quick promo for the upcoming LP Live From Earth. I cannot find anywhere where she sings Little Paradise Live so I feel like the lucky few now!"
Negative	The voice of the lord: a sermon preached in christ church, georgeton dc: It was unreadable, your could not read any page. However, Amazon refunded my money. Amazon is an amazing company, I buy all my books from Amazon.
Positive	"Bullet Proof your relationship and build attraction at the same time!: Are you a single or married guy, trying to figure out how to deal with your girlfriends'/wives' mood swings? Then I have a book for you, its called ""How To Be A 3% Man, Winning The Heart Of The Woman Of Your Dreams"" It's the best book Ive ever read, dealing in relationships, from the masculine point of view. The first time you view this book, read it and highlight it when necessary. The second time you read it, have your computer on and create rules for yourself when dealing with women, in a romantic capacity. I know why, several of my most important relationship failed; the only difference is, now I have the rules to make the relationship last and to increase the level of attraction between us!"
Negative	Padding, Padding, Padding: I have no idea whether this book has anything of worth to offer because all I found was worthless padding.There was so much padding I had to stop reading a third of the way through.Way overpriced!
Positive	Just great!: I've read few dating books from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Author will show you the most common mistakes guys do when dating with women. It really makes dating simple and fun. Thanks Corey!
Positive	Just imagine the possibilities: Imagine your life with the woman you always wanted. Imagine truly and deeply loving the person you are with and she loving you back. Imagine waking up next to an angel. Imagine being grateful for finally being with the woman you dreamed of ever since you can remember but never seemed to be able to get. Imagine finally smiling and taking a deep breath full of happiness. Well, this book can literally change your life from merely imagining to actually making it happen. This book is easy to read and it has hundreds of proven and effective strategies and ideas that will work every single time. When the student is ready the teacher appears. When you're ready for the woman of your dreams this book will be your teacher on to not only how to find and approach her but also on how to have her fall in love with you for ever.
Positive	"Babe: Enough said.: One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is cliché, that's what this is."
Positive	"Excellent Biography: An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. ""Babe"" gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get."
Positive	"Still The Best: Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first ""serious"" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."
Positive	"Babe: The Legend Comes To Life: As author of the yet to be published ""Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,"" I have read every book I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth. The more I read, the more I appreciate Creamer's exhaustive account of Ruth's playing career. This one is, by far, the best of all and I keep it with me at all times when I am in need of reference material. It is the most thorough and comprehensive. It is easy to see why this book has endured the test of time - an amazing 33 years in print. Thank you, Robert Creamer, for your truly wonderful contribution, and may you enjoy many more years in print! Sincerely, Rebecca Rau"
Positive	Babe Ruth learned: As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike
Positive	Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing.
Positive	"Good Foundation: I found this book to be packed with great information and recommend it to be added to any PHA library. It not only gives good basic knowledge, but also includes study and research paths which lead into further light and understanding of our craft in modern aspects.""Black Square and Compass"" also shows the correlation and significance of PHA in association with modern black history. For example accomplishments of the Buffalo Soldiers and the network of the Underground Railroad."
Positive	Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time.
Positive	worked perfectly!: After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly.
Negative	Not the best I have: I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. I have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. The stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if I don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. Compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. I regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when I got my small one.
Negative	very poor quality: This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires.
Positive	Great Price, Great Product: Love these and easy to use. You really can not put it though twice though if you mess up. I have only used it on a laser printer because that's what it says it's for. Awesome price so I don't wince too much when I mess up. I'll only buy these from now on.
Positive	Office Max wants $40 for this: It works on my laser printer. Only after receiving the product did I realize there is another type of film made by the same company, specifically for laser printers. This is technically for copiers (same premise, I know).
Negative	for laser printers only: This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund.
Positive	Great little known tips: I am an avid gardener who has accumulated many books on the subject. I thought to myself, why do I need one more? I originally took this book out from my local library and enjoyed it so much I wanted to buy it to have it for permanent reference. It covers everything from soil (how and when to test), to all types of plants (flowers, herbs, shrubs,etc). The illustrations are many and help visually guide the reader with steps for things like pruning, staking, composting, etc. The tips are simple and are environmentally friendly. Two things that are important to me. I'd highly recommend this book whether you have one book on gardening or 100.
Positive	Good service: I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
Positive	Great photographs.: Ok I'm a little biased on this book, since there is a hundred year old picture of my house in it. But I really loved the old pictures. The whole series of city history books published by this company are very interesting, specially if you live or own a home in the cities.
Positive	Fantastic show: My husband and I have come to love this show. It is very appropriate for children too. It is so funny and the story line is really well put together. I highly highly recommend.
Positive	The Review: Kenichi is definitely worth buying. It's full of humor and action, and who doesn't think that a guying being shown up by a female martial artist is funny.
Negative	Blah......: What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
Negative	"Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total: I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."
Negative	This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all. The characters are shallow and the situation is contrived. Reading the entire book was painful, and I would not have continued reading it if it wasn't a book club selection. Save your money and your time. Don't bother reading this book!
Positive	"We aren't in Kansas anymore: I enjoyed ""Surrender Dorothy"" very much. However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other. Ms. Woltzer shows great insight into the human heart. ""Surrender Dorothy"" was a very quick read."
Negative	Surrender this one: After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library.
Positive	"Absorbing and Felt Real: This absorbing story felt real as I went along, reading it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought ""women's literature"" books for my book club!"
Negative	Boring,Boring,Boring,,,: How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it.
Positive	funny and heartbreaking: I loved this book -- it's among Wolitzer's best. The writing is sharp, funny and epigrammatic, the characters rich, the plot full of twists and turns. I can't wait for the movie!
Negative	Would not buy were I you: The book's horrendous, a waste of money. I could have focused on other books, but sadly, did not. The worst book I have ever read, with poor characters, poor writing. I did not like at all. Was there even an editor? If you desperately want to give it a try, borrow somewhere (not that you'll find it in the library).... just don't buy it!
Negative	Disappointed: I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
Negative	Left me cold: Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on.
Positive	Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!: Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human.
Positive	"Big Chill in Little London: A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."
Negative	A little disappointed...: Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-(
Positive	"For those who like word of mouth cult movies...: and especially British underground cult movies, check out ""Final Cut"" - and then ""Love, Honour & Obey"" (the sequel, written by the same two guys, and featuring the same set of actors). The first time I saw ""Final Cut"" back in 98 I was gripped by the edgy, rawness of this ""reality movie"" format, and the shear thought-provoking nature of the film. (I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the ""Primrose Hill"" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!)."
Negative	Trash Pure and Simple: This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy. A complete piece of rubbish.
Positive	For professionals only: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques.
Negative	Not as well-made as I'd hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it.
Negative	"Not up to expectations.: I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!) He warns that not all ""outlets"" really offer great bargains -- but you have to check 'em all out yourself to find out which ones do.And guess what -- he says you can get great prices at Sams, KB Toys, and Tuesday Morning. Well, ""duh""."
Positive	Everything I ever wanted to know: This dictionary is the best medical dictionary I've come across. It's full of illustrations and makes searching for things easy.
Positive	Mosbys medical dictionary: Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures.
Positive	mosby's dictionary: it's been very helpful, i'm taking medical coding and there are things i did not know so i looked it up and was very helpful. i will continue using it.
Positive	Better Lucky than Smart: I ordered Tabers Cyclopedic guide first, but it arrived with some pages damaged in binding. And it seemed compressed in size and with its explanations. So I sent it back (thank you damage) and switched to Mosby's. Hooray! Bigger & better & more thorough with LOTS of pictures. The words searched for are printed in blue, with the definitions in black, making it easy to scan for your subject. Lucky me.
Positive	This dictionary makes looking up words fun.: I bought Mosby's because it's easy to read and look up medical terms. I'm learning the language and this book is formatted for easy readability. The numerous illustrations are all in color which I found informative. It's definitely a user-friendly dictionary.
Positive	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.
Positive	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary was bought for my wife studying to become a LicensedMassage Therapist. In the course of her Physiology studies it becameapparent that for the terminology being used required a stronger, moreprecise definition to her study even more than her Physiology book.Thismet her need and has been a tool that will become part of her workinglibrary.Jack Watson
Positive	Mosby's Medical Dictionary 7th Ed: I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
Positive	Cap in Terrell, Tx.: I really do like using Mosby's Medical Dictionary because it is an easy print to read. I am currently taking an Internet course in Medical Terminology. When I don't understand a word I quickly look it up in Mosby's Medical Dictionary for more clarification. The graphic pictures are excellent. In addition, I will be purchasing Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary.
Negative	Much Is Missing: This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. All it came with was the Atlas of Anatomy and the word definitions. So very upset with this purchase.
Positive	Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary is a great resource. It is full of wonderful color pictures and are very interesting. This book has helped me in many of my classes this semester.
Positive	Easy to understand: I bought this book to compliment my Taber's Medical Dictionary. I'm glad that I did. I found that some of the diseases in Taber's were vague and when I looked them up in Mosby's I found easy to understand definitions with lots of pictures of diseases.
Negative	I finally found it: My search is over. I have finally found the absolute worst record in the history of recorded sound. These guys are so awful they make the Dead sound like the Vienna Boys Choir. The stuff on this record cannot even be called music. They must have been great at PR, because they had absolutely no ability to make recorded sound at all. I heard that one of them is dead. Good. One down, one to go.
Negative	"One of the most disappointing Heinlein books: This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the ""gee shucks, we're in the space patrol"" line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."
Positive	A child's adventure story; an adult's classic: It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real.
Positive	One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories: This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility
Positive	A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18: JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad.
Negative	OOPS!: I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged... Let's just say I strongly recommend you do not use this inside. Your insurance WILL NOT cover any related incident!Oh, the humanity!
Positive	"DOUBLE MEASURE!: Putting things in perspective is only part of what Eduardo learns as he attempts to ""measure up"" to the RULERS. A super little bilingual story on learning how to prioritize our duties."
Negative	Mediocrity for our times: The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?
Negative	"Command and Control at the Top: Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles."
Negative	"Misses the Point: I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as ""amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,"" ""disrupt the natural order of things,"" ""seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,"" ""seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,"" ""time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,"" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
Positive	Good Godowsky.: These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts. Recording sound also leaves something to be desired.
Negative	Horrible: I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). This item, however, is not. Maybe if you are using this tool to make interesting Veg'Art, but I found it wouldn't even peel a potato properly. The peeler part is so dull I'm not sure what anyone would do with that feature. The rest of the tool is plastic. I wish I never purchased this since it is not worth paying to send the item back.
Negative	Almost awful product from Borner!: I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. The grater is almost dull, made of very thin metal that bended while sitting in the drawer. The metal blade also fell once, but I managed to insert it back. The handle is uncomfortable due to it sharp shapes. I gave the stars for the other uses, as I successfully managed to open an orange with it. It might also work for other tasks, but not for grating.I can't believe Borner was able to produce such a bad tool. I am not recommending it, as there are many other better graters on the market!
Positive	Borner Veggie Peeler: I used to have this peeler, but it was misplaced during moving. I used it for good 4 years and it never dulled, rusted, or got out of shape. Perfect quality and materials. I am glad I found it! Thank you, Amazon!
Negative	"Not Vermont American: You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand ""Do It Best"" crap FROM CHINA. Junk don't buy."
Positive	"Afterthoughts ... Music for the soul and spirit: In this busy, crazy, and sometimes angry world of ours, it is a gift to relax and listen to Kristi's arrangements of both original and classic music. I found the album a tool for helping me to relax at the end of a hard day, or to listen too simply for the soothing harmonies and flowing tonal art. Add this CD to your collection of ""Music for your Soul and Spirit."""
Positive	"VERY HARD TO FIND 1982 RELEASES! BUT VERY GOOD ONES!: I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin' this 1982 release every day. ""My Favorite Person"" had all the classic flavor of the O'Jays. Itwas probably their last classic Philly sound release as the problems Philadelphia International would have with CBS Records wouls eventually set in and a move to EMI would be forthcoming. ""Your Body's Here With Me"" is the signature cut on this reissued double album but ""My Favorite Person"", ""I Just Want To Satisfy"", and ""One On One"" were classic cuts as well. ""When Will I See You Again"" dropped great songs with their own version of the classic Three Degrees hit. Check out ""I Can't Stand The Pain"". These two albums are probably the hardest to find of all of the O'Jays albums besides the ones released on the TSOP(The Sound Of Philadelphia) label. PICK THIS ONE UP BECAUSE ITS NOW ON 1 CD!"
Positive	Good Bed: Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.
Negative	Tore within a few days. Heavy bed with 2 cedar bags inside.: This was the worst dog bed I ever purchased. Within the first few days, the fabric tore along the side seam and every time I wanted to move it, the cedar bags fell out of the giant rip. I can't imagine why this wasn't constructed with thicker fabric and industrial stitching. The bed is heavy and awkward to move. Inside are 2 cedar bags and 1 foam pad, so that when you move it, those cedar bags will overlap each other, then the bed has a big lump in it. You have to get those cedar bags side-by-side in there. What a pain! I purchased the large bed, so possibly this is why there were 2 bags. Also, you can only wash the thin outer bag that holds the cedar bags and foam pad inside.
Negative	Too noisy!: The combination of the cedar and the nylon made this bed incredibly noisy. I had to pick my dog and put her on it, and once she got off of it, she wouldn't go back on. She looked at me like she was being tortured being on it. She did sleep on it for one night but wouldn't go back on it at all. Not exactly the dog bed I had in mind.
Negative	Great group, poor dvd: Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video.
Negative	crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007: DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980's.Title is misleading. Sound is also out of sync on some songs. Dissapointng.Live in L.a.
Negative	"Santana - Live by Request: War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
Negative	Nothing New!! Same as SuperNatural but......: Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
Positive	Still Amazing: Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content.
Positive	"Nutritious and delicious: Though one reviewer felt the format of this book was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for ""cooked rice"" or ""cooked peas"". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth."
Positive	Recipes for a Small Planet: Great book for vegetarian recipes. Great for a new vegetarian oranyone who enjoys meatless recipes.
Negative	Nearly Useless: I've owned this cookbook for years. A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy.
Positive	Bought it again for our second child!: These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. They have pockets for the photos rather than those electrostatic pages which makes them far easier to use (in my opinion). They also have space to write notes next to each photo. We liked the one we got for our daughter so much, we bought another when we had our son.
Positive	Good: This is an excellent item. The seller shipped fast and I am 100% satisfied with the overall transaction. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
Positive	They didn't live happily every after: Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna.
Negative	Not good: If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing.
Positive	beautiful dancing: I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to Aradia after seeing how professional she always looks in her magazine photos, but having read all the other reviews, I took a chance and bought this dvd. I can only add to the praise by saying, Aradia took her time and thoughtfully planned all the components of this dvd. Might not be suitable for a beginner, but if you are a beginner, get this dvd anyway so you have it when you are ready for it.
Positive	So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it.
Negative	Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!
Negative	Not true to description!: Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section.
Positive	Excelente: Manu es una de los mejores cantantes del Operacion Triunfo.Aunque la musica es un poco 'easy listening', este CD es su premera y Manu la hace muy bien y no se falta su voz. Me encanta este chico y creo que el va a hacer mucho mas.
Positive	Touching, sad, but moving and worth the read: Although many people think that reading such books as these, the accounts of teenagers who died while under the Nazi regime, is depressing...people should tell them, it should be. This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you.
Negative	I don't like it: IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. no action at all. I had to read it for a school project on the holocaust and I ended up changing my book. I personally thought it wasn't good.
Negative	We Are Witnesses: When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book.
Positive	"This is a good book: I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."
Negative	Ok I guess: This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective.
Positive	Book=Very GOOD!: I thought this book was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager's lives and the victims of the Holocaust. It was sad to know how well-off Americans in the U.S. and other fortunate people had it then. When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others. But I would have liked it more if he would have described more about what the Nazis would do to the victims after they were transported. Otherwhise, I liked this book very much.
Positive	"Outstanding CD: I have all 4 cd's - now waiting for the new cd, November 24 ... ""All of the Above"" thank you Brian Maes for some of the best music to come around in years."
Positive	Caught the fever!: I was introduced to this band by some friends. Not only are their covers better than some of the original recordings but Brian's love songs are amazing. Give a listen this cd, specifically I'm Gonna Stay and the title track, The Great Symphony.
Negative	Sent wrong book: I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
Negative	A flimsy and heavily biased account of problems in America: Thomas Sullivan attempts to cover a broad array of social problems confronting American society. He addresses race, drugs, crime, social inequality, gender, and many other relevant issues. I found his assessment of these issues superficial often misapplying or incorrectly citing material referenced. His ideology is readily apparent, and throughout most of the book influences his discussion of the issues. Instead of taking an objective and critical look at our social problems, he embarked on a one-sided journey of his personal opinion. Unfortunately, I was required to use this book in a course on Social Issues. I am hopeful that anyone considering this book in the future will see this review and avoid it at all costs.
Negative	One of the great medieval Jewish poets and thinkers: Solomon ibn Gabriol 1021-1058 is one of the great Jewish medieval poets and thinkers. He lived a difficult life of wandering . His poetry is filled with a strong sense of the majesty of God. And his works are part of the Jewish liturgy.
Negative	Crack: I gave it to a friend. He put it in the freezer to use that evening and when he pulled it out it was cracked. :( Disappointing.
Negative	all cracked up: Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn't know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can't get full refund...sad :(
Positive	AWESOME MOVIE A MUST SEE: I Loved this Movie Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Zoey Saldana has a huge impact in this film. I have multiple copies of this film in my home some how lol but it is well worth it. A must see buy it. Pop some popcorn and enjoy :)
Negative	"Good beginning, bad ending: This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."
Positive	A plain and simple NASB...: This Bible is the new updated NASB translation. The translation is accurate, but this particular Bible has only the basics. The print is fairly cramped, and as far as extra perks go, there are a few B&W maps and a small concordance. A good economy Bible to own, but no special frills.
Negative	Poor quality.: I bought 4 of these Bibles (same ISBN) at a local Christian bookstore. They have the imitation leather cover. All of the covers have come unbound from the pages. Very poor quality. I love the NASB, but this is just poorly made.
Positive	NASB: Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand.
Positive	Fun, suspenseful movie: This DVD is in fine condition and the movie is well done as well as exciting and fun to watch. My husband and I both enjoyed it despite our different tastes when it comes to movies.
Negative	Why so much?: I've heard of this movie and was interested in picking it up. But can one of youmovie nerds explain why the price for this is so high?
Positive	"Was he?: The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
Positive	A Dead Hero!: This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans. It was a clever plot to plant a body with rank, papers, and identification in a location that was backed by information of tides, sea currents, etc. There was the usual anxious feelings of being discovered especially when the Germans decided to send a spy to England to verify whether this person really existed. The plot becomes more tense when he confronts the woman whose picture was found on the body along with a love letter!
Positive	The Man Who Never Was: Although later historical facts have put a few holes in the details of this CD and the original book, the content was in the main true to the actual happenings. Clifton Webb's acting job was top notch. A good spy stroy based on actual events.
Positive	A Classic British WWII Film: This film showes the Brits as the Masters of faking out the Crowns Enemies. It also shows that not all the most effective fighting involves fix bayonets and charge.
Negative	"I'm glad the man never was, I wish the movie never was either!: Adopting the story of operation ""Mincemeat"" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined."
Negative	"Dull as Lead: Thirty minutes into the film, viewing it in w/s, I ejected the disc. I thought the characters were two-dimensional. I thought the script was hackneyed. I thought the direction was plodding. ""Dam Busters"" held my interest. ""The Man Who Never Was"" did not."
Positive	Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story: If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time.
Positive	The Man Who Never Was: This one of the iconic British movies from the 1950's. The story line and the cast were just magnificent. I have watched this movie many times over the years, mainly on late night television. I was surprised that the movie is still available. The story is based on true events from thne 2nd WW and this forgotten hero in one effort did a lot to help shorten the War. His father should be given more recognition for the act of selfless love in donating his Sons body to the war effort.
Positive	A good quality WWII movie bases on a true story: To think that British Intelligence created this allusion to fool the Nazis during World War II is just magnificent. A ripping good yarn. Well done Amazon.com. This DVD is not released in AUSTRALIA. Making the purchase on line was simple, quick and easy. Regards Mr. T J SOMERVILLE, GAWLER EAST, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA
Positive	Cheers for The Man Who Never Was: I had always tought of clifton Webb as that weird guy who starred only in The Stars And Stripes For Ever, A 1950's verson of The Titanic and Cheaper By The Dozen. He comes a accross as a brilliant ex attorney, an Hercules Poirot type almost, trying to think one step ahead of the Gerries in this wonderful espionage thriller.True there are no big battle scenes but how all the pieces come together and the tension that builds when the German spy comes to check on things was masterful. Everything fits.I had read the book on this tale at 15 and now at 42 have seen the film for the first time and give it 4 + stars.
Positive	"An exciting World War II movie: I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
Negative	Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story: I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes. It's that bad. I ordered it after reading Operation Mincemeat. The film is a sort anti-Ken Follet film--not the eye of the needle but the eye of a tunnel. No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print.
Negative	Live Suprise!: This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. I like some Live music but this is not what I wanted. Order a different one.
Negative	Wrong item!: After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. This cd is Live, and they don't tell that in the details. It is also a poor version, even if you like Live music, I don't think you will like this.
Positive	from a doula dad: The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze.
Negative	"A few good, a lot bad: There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"
Positive	Ballets of the Forties and Fifties described.: For someone interested in the ballets before 1956 and the ballet companies who danced them, this is for you. This is what happened to the ballet world after Diaghilev's death in 1929. Out of this new world were born the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theater) and the New York City Ballet founded by George Balanchine who got his start with Diaghilev's company.
Positive	Al Green Love and Happiness: This is a classic CD set...I will keep forever and pass on to my kids. Love it!!!!
Positive	Tight Jam by R.Kelly: this is the direction R.Kelly is going with on his Musical Virus Project.this cut has a cool Jamaican Feel. R.Kelly is channeling elements of Bob Marley&Harry Belefonte on his vocal runs. real smooth joint. this track is so Cool&has a soulful vibe all the way through.I ai't feeling the Re-Mix though. but I like the direction He his taken with going in different directions.this is a Classic Kells Jam.
Negative	Surface Noise!!!!!!: Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!
Negative	This Is Crap: If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. Cristina is great but this cd is obviously taken from vinyl and sounds horrible. You can actually hear the record static and the high hats will hurt your ears. I'm going to return mine.
Positive	"It was a fiction book...: I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book. Keep it close to you. It will happen...""England will be the World Cup Champion again."
Negative	Way too many ads: In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read.
Positive	Men's Fitness: Men's Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. It was easy to read on the kindle fire also.
Positive	fitness: It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
Negative	Cancelled Subscription: I've been a long time subscriber to Men's Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. I have an android based tablet with the Kindle App and it would be great to read online and keep previous issues without taking up space. Unfortunately, Amazon/Men's Fitness does not support their Android based Kindle app, so I cancelled the subscription.
Positive	"Great magazine: Loaded with workout tips and guides (even if you think you know it all). Focuses on working out and not on the normal crud that fills the others - if I wanna know ""10 pickup lines that work 90% of the time, every time"" then I can pickup one of those other magazines that by the title you'd think would be focusing on working out, but is filled with fluff!"
Negative	Six months past, I never get the magazine.: I never get my magazine, it turns out to be the company got the wrong address. So i have to wait another 4~5 months to get my magazine. I can't get my magazine until June or July. Making me so upset!
Negative	Don't Order this product: The magizine itself was good with the one issue they sent. I only received one issue then did not receive another. I ordered in June and now it's September. I received one Magazine. I contacted Men's Fitness Customer Support who said they would reply in 24-48 hours and it's now been a week in a half with nothing. I used to receive Men's Health and I am now going to make the switch. It's more money, but they actually show up each week. Very bad Customer Service. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Negative	Awful Service: Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
Positive	Not as good as it once was: I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars.
Negative	Its all shell.: This magazine has great covers and gets your attention right away. I was was drawn to the cover because it claims to have great article inside, but the articles are very short and pointless. It was a good magazine few years back but now it just seems like they don't know what their doing.
Negative	"Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds.: Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."
Negative	Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer: I'm sorry to say this but this book is absolutely horrible. This is my third year in college and this has to be the worst text book I've ever had. The text is not very informative and the examples are unclear. The book doesn't go into detail on most of the basic material. This is NOT a good book for an introductory level circuit analysis course.
Negative	"Don't waste your time: I'm a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. This book is absolutly worthless. The auther jumps to great leaps of understanding with littel or no background to show the student how they got to those conclusions. The examples are non excistant. They use ""conventional current"" which is really backward to reality. It used to be called ""hole theory"" back in the day. Go with Boylstead or somone who has a clue about teaching. If your a beginning electronics student, forget this book, you'll be lost by the 1st chapter. There are countless problems too lengthy to go into detail here. If your school is using it, spend the extra money and get somthing to actually learn from, just to pass the course."
Negative	"Really bad!: This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."
Negative	Not good: This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. I was disapointed, would not reccomend getting this book
Negative	Required for course: This book was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct...this book sucks. Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover.
Positive	"Hidden Gem!!: After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. ""My Love Leads You Home"" & ""Shamballa"" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer. To this day, Ramsey Lewis continues to entertain and gives us a hard to find treasure!Buy it if you can find it!!"
Negative	Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN: This is by far the worst book I have ever read on this topic. People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good.
Negative	False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually.
Negative	An abomination: I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas.
Positive	Review of False Intimacy: The book, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it's content is truly amazing and informative. Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!
Positive	Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band .
Positive	Great DVD: I have had the video tape of this Roxy Music performance for years. I watched it a lot but the tape was old and I was very pleased to find it on DVD in its origional form. If you like Roxy Music this is a 5 star performance.
Negative	doesn't come with what's pictured......: Does not come with gaskets!!!!!!!! These pictures are maddeningly misleading at times. I could have saved money buying another but this showed all I needed, but didn't come as promised.
Positive	"Thought Provoking...Interesting: This book raises questions of conspiracy with its story of how history is altered according to the times and whims (?) of the few. I recommend this book for anyone studying history, and anyone who wants to know ""the truth."""
Negative	Meh.: Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys.
Negative	totally unnecessary: this product is ridiculous... all you need to remove garlic smell from hands is to rub your hands on ANY stainless steel item under running water. just about any knife in your kitchen will work, as will pots, cutlery, the sink itself, etc.
Negative	I don't think this works...: I bought 4 of these to distribute as gifts to my mother, sister, sister in law and myself. We all cook with tons of garlic and I thought it would be the perfect gift. We tried using the eggs after a day of intense cooking and it didn't seem to work. Ours hands still smelled of garlic and onions.
Positive	"Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno: Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. I first came across this group in the flamenco movie ""El Amor Brugo"" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song ""Azucar Moreno"" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced."
Positive	Handy lil mp3 player: I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have.
Negative	"Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
Positive	"Delivers what it promises.: Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, ""Creative Projects."" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the ""Tickle me Lego"" toy, to fun things for adults like ""Machine with Minifig,"" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation. I especially liked the internet resources listed in the back.CONS:Projects are not laid out in step-by-step detail in the book. (They are on the CD-ROM)."
Negative	Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided: I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT.
Negative	Character sheets with different pictures: Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in.
Positive	great material hampered by poor layout: Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read.
Negative	"Poor scholarship: This book is another example of ""hands-off"" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources. In summary, in deciding whether to purchase this book---pass!"
Positive	Helpful Book on Pastors Changing Churches: Paul Robbins is the editor of this book, but each chapter is actually written by a different person. Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject.
Positive	Good To Go: This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album.
Negative	Predictable and Unrealistic: I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
Positive	most intense book i've ever read !!!: I read Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. When I saw Amazon book search it was the first thing that came to mind. Definetly the best scary book ever once you start you just cant stop
Positive	One of the all time best reads ever!: I read this maybe 20 years ago, and have to read it again. SOOO good, so intense, scary, awesome!! Great plot twist. It should have been a bestseller!!
Negative	"Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny: I read this book as a result of reading the reviews at this site. While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a ""Young Adult"" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across."
Positive	Disturb not the dream: I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
Positive	Old favorite: i first read this book back in the 1980s and loved it. Unfortunately, I lent the book to a friend and never got it back. Always wanted to read it again but I could never find it in any stores. Was able to find it on Amazon, ordered it and thoroughly enjoyed rereading it.
Positive	From the lyrics to the chords, this album is full of talent: These Anaheim boys know how to rock my world. Their music is upbeat, fun and easy to dance to. I definitely recommend checking it out and while you're at it, check out their website (mysuperhero.com) If you like music with style you'll love My Superhero!!!
Positive	This book should be on our shelves as Pastors: I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. The series is uneven, and occasionally goes overboard in literary/source criticism. But one up-to-date, critical commentary on Genesis should be on our shelves, and this is about the best.
Positive	Awesome baby prunes!: My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
Positive	Historical and family content a MUST READ!!!: I loved this book. It has a great historical content to the founding of our nation, as well as the beginning of the LDS church. It has photos and letters spanning four generations, and amazing stories throughout. I particularly loved the letters during the war of 1812. For our family, it's particularly a touching memoir as it is our direct ancestor line. It is not only a must read, but we are purchasing additional copies for our children to have when they are grown. Beautifully written, and well researched. It doesn't get better than this!
Negative	Do not read this book!: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated.
Negative	SUTURE SELF: Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!
Positive	Mysterious hospital deaths: Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series.
Negative	Time to quit series!: I have read each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful. But I will pass on the Bed & Breakfast series from now on.
Positive	get what you pay for: Fine item, does what it needs to, the wires are small but works just fine. If you need a long cable like I did for a chase pipe run, then it works.
Positive	Early learning toy: My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. The buttons on this toy are easy to push and knobs easy to turn. He was frustrated by his other pop up toy that he could rarely get to work with his tiny hands. This allows his cognitive abilities to develop even before his fine motor skills would be ready to use other toys.
Negative	"Requires too much strength for toddlers: The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen ""reward"" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required."
Positive	Great easy toy: My twins love this toy. They can use it on their own and it only makes small noises. The only down side is one seems to get his finger in the way when he pushes the tops down. I love the quality of tolo toys.
Negative	not safe and no fun: once you get this toy in your hands you can see the cheap construction--the buttons don't work smoothly and the egg-tops are easy to pull off: just the right size for my toddler to pop in his mouth! i chucked this one right in the garbage....
Negative	Of little interest: My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough.
Positive	She is a good singer.: Stacie Orrico is a good singer. She has a God given talent. Even though her ways have changed she always has the ability to sing.
Negative	"""eh"" What was I thinking?: Ok I loath britney and Christina.And though I'm more of a Rock Music kinda guy myself, even I sometimes get pulled in by alot of catchy tunes from the secular pop music world. And sometimes I hate myself for singing that shallow filth. Stacie is SO GREAT! I've heard all the songs from her album. They're all so good, and the quality is far beyond Britney or Christina. Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old. I am now an official Fan and will buy anything she comes out with! I think she's way better then Rachael Lampa, but thats only cause her music has faster beats."
Positive	"An excellent debut CD!: If you are considering purchasing Stacie Orrico's first CD ""Genuine,"" I would highly recommend it. This CD has a good mix of upbeat songs and sweet, slow tunes. ""Don't Look At Me"" was a big hit on Christian music charts, and for good reason! This is a great song with an awesome message. ""O O Baby"" is a really fun song with a good beat. My personal favorite on the album is ""Dear Friend,"" the final song on the CD, which Stacie wrote herself. It is a song about a friend who doesn't feel good about herself, but Stacie is trying to tell her that she is beautiful and that God loves her no matter what. This song has a beautiful melody and a powerful message. I highly recommend this CD. :-)"
Positive	"Stacie rocks!!!!!!: This CD is a must buy.It has awesome mixture of pop and R&B.Stacie Orrico has a beautiful, powerful voice.This CD is for anyone who likes Britney or Christina but hates their lyrics.My favorite songs are, ""Don't Look at Me"",""Stay True"",and Genuine""."
Positive	The Best: This is the best CD ever. The sound of Stacie Orrico's voice is great and the lyrics are great. You would nt excpect such a great sound from a 14 year old but she definitely pulls it off. The songs are suprisingly very pop-like.
Positive	"So Cool!: This CD is great! It's lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as ""Dear Friend"" and ""Everything I Have"" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track ""Stay True"""
Positive	"Awesome CD!!: Stacie Orrico is one talented teenager! I have to say, I was very surprised to find she was so young! I think it's wonderful and refreshing to have someone like Stacie Orrico in Christain Music. It sort of puts the ""life"" into the Christain Music for the average young person (or young at heart!:) who may find other Christain groups a bit dull or the music outdated. I bought this CD about a month ago and I can't stop listening to it. My daughter loves it too. I think the best songs are ""Without Love"", and ""Restore My Soul"". I didn't like every song at first, but they have a wonderful message and a catchy tune and I love them all now. If you like Christina Aguilara and Mariah Carrey, you'll LOVE Stacie Orrico."
Positive	Satisfied: I paid 50 cents for this. Which was not bad at all. It was in good conditions for the price. One of the song did skip a little. But over all it was great for the price.
Positive	WONDERFUL: I Love this CD. She is a great witness and all of her songs a great.Ride(9/10)very catchyDon't look at me(15/10)I love this song. It is definitely one of my favroites.O.O Baby(7/10)a little hard to understand but still good.Without Love(10/10)A song with a great tune and a great message.Stay True(20/10)my favroite Stacie Orrico song (you have to hear it to understand, but trust me its great)Genuine(10/10)A song that is genuinely great. A really great sound.With a little Faith(9/10)A good message and it's fun.So Pray(10/10)a great message. It is bold but she does a great job with it. I LOVE it.Holdin' On(9/10)really fun words and a great message!Restore my Soul(8/10)a lot like Holdin' On. Not as up-beatConfidant(10/10) I Love the tune and words.Everthing(6/10)Sweet but not very catchy.Dear Friend(13/10)A song that came from her heart and she wrote it her self which I really admire.
Positive	this cd is tight: Stacie Orrico is Christian's Britney Spears. (Thats not a bad thing though!!). This album is worth the money because this girl can sing. My fave tracks on here are: Ride, O.O. Baby (my fave song!!), Without Love, Genuine, So Pray, Restore My Soul, Confidant, and Dear Friend. The rest of the tracks are so-so. But get her CD anyway, and go get her X-mas album too!!
Positive	Totally Awesome!: Stacie Orrico is the best. Honestly, I downloaded all of her songs on Napster and I loved it. I loved the cd so much, I decided to buy the cd and support her so She will bring out new albums. Family Christian review says She is Destiney's Child with a Christian theme. I personally think along the lines of Aguilera with a Christian Theme. I am always glad to see young teen artist take a stand for Christ. Some of my favorite songs of hers are Don't Look at me, Stay True, and Dear Friend. I find myself putting their songs on repeat alot. If you want peak at her cd, goto http://www.launch.com/music/artistpage/1,4391,1048259,00.html(vocals included) or http://www.stacieorrico.com/ (just music, no vocals). And Rememeber, If your looking for perfection, don't look at (wo)men, Look at Him.
Positive	Pretty Darn Good Stuff: I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone.
Positive	"skeptical about pop music...: i'm usually really skeptical about pop music. if that pop sound is comin' outa the radio, ya gotta listen to the lyrics! Stacie sounds alot like Christina agulara, but i often question christina's meaning behind her lyrics, like in Genie in a bottle ""if ya wanna be with me"" and ""ya gotta rub me the right way"" really make me ask questions. when i listen to Stacie's album i know that what i'm listening to is clean and pleasing to God. this is defenitly the cd to buy, because everybody knows that you eventually memorize what you listen to no matter if you mean to or not. that also influences your thoughts. don't ask any more questions, just buy this cd right now!"
Positive	Is this Christina??: This CD is amazing! Her voice talent is amazing! She will remind you of Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, I also feelA little bit of Mariah Carey in this CD! I would reccomend it to any one!
Negative	Great Saw At First But Don't Use Too Often: I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. Everything on it worked great. A couple of months later the handle to tighten the miter adjustment stripped out. I ordered replacement parts from Makita and received them in a very timely fasion. Shortly after that it stripped again so I made my own replacement parts that work much better. Unfortunately other cheap plastic parts on it are starting to fail and fall apart. I am a big believer in Makita tools and own many for my contracting business, but I strongly suggest buying a different saw. The best part on the saw is the folding stand which I now use to hold my old De Walt rack and pinion table saw.
Negative	"disappointing read: Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
Positive	A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance.: Bob Holtel captures the essence of all essential ingredients that combine to produce an envied athletic endurance achievement. For anyone who has rested on their own laurels of completing a marathon or two, only they can truly appreciate Bob's accomplishment - Running four consecutive marathons every week, 12 weeks straight for three consecutive summers, on uneven rocky trails and at altitude!!! The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account. As an athlete I am honored to have shared the adventure. This book has produced a new hero who has proved again that with vision, preparation, planning and courage you can accomplish your dreams.
Positive	A pleasure to read!: This book really is a must have for the PCT collector. This was a sweet read and I'd recommend it. I'd love to know this man, seems like a real gem of a guy. He had good running on the trail, made a great read.
Negative	"New meaning to the term ""thin""!: Description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement. More like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers. Made in China of only 74% down. To state that this comforter has a retail price of $160 is laughable! Really more of a throw than a comforter. At $50 it is grossly overpriced! Look elsewhere!"
Positive	Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal.
Positive	"Lightweight and Warm: The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
Positive	ok for the price: This comforter is ok for the price.its nto 100% down , so expect some mix.but overall , nice to have a extra ,maybe in the guestroom or so.Overall satisfied.
Positive	"Stands the test of time: This was a very good read. I felt the same ""distancing"" from my husband that Betina did for the same reasons; kids, life, social expectations.The book stands up in todays world, just as it did back in 1967."
Positive	I wont have that husband!!: This is a fabu book...all young women can learn from this book...this is the man NOT to marry...
Positive	Good Read!: Diary of a Mad Housewife is a really enjoyable read. It's funny and true. It has a lot to say about life and I would recommend this book to any woman looking for a fun read!
Positive	Great mastery of domestic details...: makes me feel that I understand Tina's life across time and space. For any woman who looks at her life and wonders what happened.
Negative	very basic self talk: This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer.
Positive	Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life: Michael J. Russ empowers you to let go of unsupportive self-talk and make supportive self-talk your second nature. He provides you with a highly effective and accessible manual for redesigning the way you think about yourself. This book is essential for anyone who wants to be truly happy from within and experience success in every area of their life. It will help you to drastically improve yourself and overcome any challenge you may encounter. This book is your best guide towards controlling a personal power that will help you take quantum leaps towards making radical changes in your life and accomplishing anything. It is the key to becoming your best and most positive self!
Negative	This is not the screenplay: This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. If you are looking for the script for the 1987 film, keep looking.
Positive	Really makes a difference: Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. The slip-ons eliminate the need for stock butt modifications if you can put up with an additional inch of pull. Highly recommended.
Positive	"His Second Album: Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (""Chicken Truck"" and ""I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal""). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase."
Positive	real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. John Anderson is the real deal. This is what country sounds like without the glitter. Drawing from originals like Lefty Frizzell, Anderson's vocals are authentic; haunting on the sad songs. Great musicianship. I highly recommend it.
Negative	a good historical book: if you like history books read this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afro\amer. after the civil war
Positive	Great Smoke Taste: Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
Positive	Bradley Special Blend Bisquettes 48 pack: These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great.
Positive	Good flavor to meat.: The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
Positive	Woodlands Smoker: Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. The burn thoroughly and produce great smoke for the perfect taste. Everyones loves the result.
Positive	Awesome Product!: We love our smoker and we love the smoker chips/bisquettes! The Bradley Cherry Bisquettes add a great flavor to Chicken, pork and beef! They are cheaper on Amazon than at Bass Pro or Cabelas.
Positive	Bradley Pecan Bisquettes: They worked as advertised . I have used and enjoyed the flavor they impart to the meat . I also enjoy the apple flavor
Positive	A great comfort: Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe.
Negative	"Worst CD I bought in 5 years: I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""
Negative	Gimme a break: This is ridiculously preachy stuff. I can tolerate a bit of leftiness in my folk, I find the sincerity touching, but this is too over the top to listen to all the way through more than once.
Negative	Spare us the Preachy Folk Crap!: Ry Cooder is an incredible musician, but that does not automatically make you a great songwriter or a great album maker. He should stick to instrumental and soundtrack music, something he's good at.
Negative	"quite boring...: I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
Negative	Buddy: I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all.
Positive	Warms the heart.: I am not American. Nor do I usually buy this kind of music. I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there. Its simple messages warm the heart. If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music.
Positive	Ry's best work: This is an amazing disc. Much like his early work (Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, etc.), this song cycle recreates the dust bowl era in modern sonic terms and musical language. It combines folk, jazz, blues, and protest songs into a charming, intelligent and entertaining mixture. If you are a fan of classic American music and clever storytelling, then this is the CD for you. It's the aural equivalent of some of Steinbeck's novels (`The Grapes of Wrath' and `Travels With Charlie' come to mind), crossed with `The Wind in the Willows'. That may sound like an odd mixture, but the results are wonderful.As in the best American folk music of the era Cooder is recreating, these songs are political motivated, socially aware and purposefully accessible to a wide group of people. His take on this form would do Woody Guthrie proud. This is the best musical purchase I've made in quite a while.
Positive	Ry Cooder: As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30's. He has continually explored the origins of music from Africa to Cuba to Mexico to early America with consumate ease. My Name Is Buddy is only available on import in Australia and not for general release so I am proud to have my copy included in my collection. I trust that he, and others, continue to explore our musical roots and Ry Cooder remains as one of the Four or five artists who have had a profound effect on my musical knowledgePaul Thomas Australia
Positive	Ry Cooder My name is Buddy: I do like the atmosphere on this CD. It brings back memories of the folk mmusic from when I was young (sixties, early seventies. I also like lyrics and his views on society.
Positive	"Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being ""red,"" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too."
Negative	1 month to ship?: I ordered it on april 11, now it's apr. 29. I just found that it's going to be shipped on May 12th.It is just a trash can. Are you casting this after getting order? custom made? what's wrong with you? I don't cancel this order only because it was supposed to be included in free super saving shipping.
Positive	Great product: This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin.
Positive	Nice but not the best: I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products.
Positive	Great for smoothing and repairing sensitive skin: Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. I use this a few nights each week to even out troubled-looking areas. It is very gentle and leaves my face looking and feeling healthier in the morning.
Positive	Fair: It is a very fair tribute to Celia. It's a shame that it was done so late when she wasn't abble to sing as she used to. The singers do well, but it leaves a sad taste to see Celia just sitting and listen to her songs being interpretated by others.
Positive	Excellent: So interesting! This product is excellent. I recomend it.This CD is excellent!....Try it, try it...you will see Love Celia and all the artists!
Negative	DVD CON PROBLEMAS: ESTE DVD LLEGO EN BUEN TIEMPO. SIN EMBARGO, SE FREEZA EN LA CANCION NUMERO 1 INTERPRETADA POR VICTOR MANUEL, UNA DE LAS MEJORES.
Negative	Regret Purchase: It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. I expected more based on the reviews and I was very disappointed.
Positive	The best of recent books on Wordsworth and Coleridge.: Eilenberg's book opens the complex and fascinating topic of intellectual property, in addition to providing brilliant readings of the major poems of these two seminal Romantic poets.
Negative	Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book: This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'
Positive	World Encyclopedia of Bread: Excellent book for beginners. A must for anyone who wants to fresh taste of home made bread. Excellent photographs and guidelines. Included also is method for adapting recipes for bread machines. As the name says it recipes from all over the world like England, Mediterranean and Asia are discussed, not to mention the American and festive type breads. I love it & sure that you will too
Negative	Worst dubbing ever!: Fast beat motivating music. Average workout. But the dubbing is so bad as to be comically distracting. Might be better if you speak German, but with English dubbing, it's intolerable.
Positive	camco wrench: This is a great tool. Due to arthritis, I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely. This enabled me to insert the plug(a replacementmetal one)with no leaks!
Negative	Inaccurate description: My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better.
Positive	an almost necessary tool.: I could easily have made this tool, but I'm getting lazy in my old age. It beats using a pair of channel locks, and much neater.
Negative	Wasn't what I wanted: This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight.
Negative	The ad didn't say what size this thing was: I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Since there was no choice of size, I assumed one size fits all. Well, unfortunately, one size does not fit all and this drain plug is too small for my drain plug.
Negative	Did Not Work For Me: Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. I expected that it would be a general universal RV water heater drain valve wrench, but I was wrong I guess. I have a Minnie Winnegago, and have a water heater that is a very common one used. I wasted my money. I had alreay thrown away the package so now I can't return it. Wish I would have known it would not work. The product itself isn't bad quality, but I thought the title and description of this product was not accurate.
Positive	plastic tool: works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic
Positive	Did not fit my Coleman E3: This appears to be perfectly fine as long as it fits. I guess the Coleman E3 does not use a standard fitting so it does not fit.
Positive	great stuff: These are just the beat scrubbies I'ver used. They don't scratch and they last forever. None of my local stores carry them anymore.
Positive	"Chore Boy Golden Fleece: I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Then, once they get old, after a month or two, they ""graduate"" to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks! Now that I am an adult, I can't stop using them. I even have my husband hooked! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops, so I ordered them...and got a great deal!"
Positive	Golden Fleece is the BEST: Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!
Positive	"Raised body temperature and metabolism: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."
Negative	not a healthy product: I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk.
Negative	"It made me gain weight.: This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just ""guggul"". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them."
Negative	Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!: 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album.
Negative	Should put his talent to better use....: Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only.
Negative	What happened to Larry Carlton?: The elevator has arrived. Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!
Positive	What's with all the complaining?: Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars.
Negative	"Larry's Careful New Album: I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."
Negative	"The obligatory contractual album: It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of ""talk a lot but say nothing"". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass."
Positive	Chrysler/Blower: This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly. Haven't had any problems, but it has been in the vehicle only about a month.I would buy from this distributor again, especially since their price is half of what a car dealer wanted.
Negative	Crap: This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!
Negative	the movie rocks, BUT...: ... sometimes it's nice to see that, indeed sometimes we germans clearly get better editions of some movies than you americans do. and in this case, the german company E-M-S did a very cool 2-disc Special Edition of Perdita Durango (original title) with the original english soundtrack. so I'd recommend this edition to all you americans with region-free-players, 'cause THIS FILM ROCKS UNCUT!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative	Didint understand much: I'm not sure what the plot was for this movie, I really don't know what i got the movie either maybe i wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don't know but wasn't all that great.
Negative	Dance with the Devil: This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
Negative	A Waste of a Picture: This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?....
Negative	A Piece of Trash: This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen. If the director De la Iglesia has some Tarantino influence, he went too far. It also depicts Mexicans as cult members and grotesque.It places people in the Caribbean speaking with a Castillian accent. A real piece of trash and mentally disturbing.
Negative	So bad.: This movie is so violence and so evil. It 's for those who love sex, drugs, etc. Children must beware of.
Negative	"Great movie, but...: This is a great work by Alex de la Iglesia, but sadly this edition (""unrated"") has been butchered by A-pix. Many shots have been removed or replaced by video generated titles.Also, one of the high and emotional moments of the ending has been completely removed.If you can't get the original version, get this one. You will enjoy it because it is still a great movie. I give this edition only one star because I can't accept loosing that key moment at the end."
Negative	"Be aware!: Don't blow 35 bucks on this because it says it's ""unrated"", here. They're ALL UNRATED, and you can find the same thing for just a few bucks elsewhere on this site!"
Positive	"Miller's overlooked art: Steve Miller is probably the world's most underated guitarist. He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong ""Little Girl"" and the civil rights motif ""Don't you let nobody"" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. ""Baby's House"" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. ""Motherless Children"" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it. If not, you might want to start off his early stuff with Antholgy."
Positive	THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE: Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
Negative	I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem: I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results
Negative	Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally.
Positive	WONDERFUL BOOK: If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!
Positive	"VERY TEEN-MUSIC CD: I really Like This CD because I like this kind of ""Teen Music"". It seems Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera with a bad day and Enrique Iglesias... Its Just a GOOD CD.ME PIERDO JUNTO A TI: A VERY GOOD song, I love it. (9/10)VAS A VOLVERME LOCA: Good, but not the best from the CD. (7/10)LA LECCIÓN: One of the best songs. (10/10)LA NOCHE LLEGÓ: Very ""Enrique Iglesias Style"". (8/10)NO SOY UN ÁNGEL: Not very bad...but too Machine (6/10)NADIE COMO TÚ: VERY GOOD. Too Romantic (10/10)UN HOMBRE DE VERDAD: ¡¡GOOD!! (7/10)TU ME SALVASTE AYER: So...Funny!!! (9/10)DONDE ESTÉS EL CIELO ESTARÁ: It's not very bad...(6/10)ESCÚCHAME: VERY VERY GOOD! (10/10)ENGLISH TRACKS: Not very bad at all...but in English. (6/10)"
Positive	"Brimful of Styles: We already knew that Cornershop represented a unique brew of styles. This single goes two steps further. ""Sleep"" is remixed in a 1983 New Wave style sure to evoke memories of Thomas Dolby and Falco. Norman Cook's incomparable mix of ""Asha"" is already world-famous, own it for 10 bucks less than the import."
Negative	"Not Impressed: Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching.The menu doesn't work! I can't bring up one specific dance routine to learn off of the menu, I can only hit""play all"" then fast forward to the routine I want to work on.Plus on the first dance he starts out doing the dance for like 3-4 minutes, then he teaches you the steps, then another minute of dance time... shouldn't he begin with teaching the steps, then go into an extended dance time?"
Negative	Rip Off: First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know.
Positive	An Acquaintance with darkness: A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it.
Positive	"Pretty Good: I really liked this book! It is a Classic ""Rinaldi"". I really like Ann Rinaldi style of writing and it is filled with all sorts of excitement. One thing that was a bit different than most of her books is that is was sort of ""dark"". It is not a real ""happy"" book to read although it is very good."
Positive	Excellent content, Very easy reading, Historically correct!: I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much. It was nice to have the author describe in detail at the end where the actual fact ended and where the fiction began. You really understood why Emily was confused and felt for the country at the loss of the President. I would highly recommend this book for everyone from middle school age thru adult!
Negative	An Aquaintance with Darkness: Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance.
Positive	This book was Phnomenal: This was Ann's best book yet. The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.
Positive	The Madness of Life: In this book Emily's world crumbles beneath her feet when her mother dies. She goes with her uncle instead of to her friend's (Annie) house like her mother and she had planned. After all of this she decides to stay in control of her life. By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book. I like it also because it was based on the truth and I like how the book ended, I guess you could say it was a different ending.
Positive	One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not.
Negative	Dark is right!: A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books.
Positive	"Truly an ""Acquaintance With Darkness"": This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic. The book makes the characters realistic. It is haunting and morbid. I would suggest this book for anyone who would like a most creative and intersting view on the Civil War."
Positive	First thought, bummer, as I read on more like Bravo!!!: The first paragraph or so , it was like Mrs. Rinaldi you can do better but as I read on I was like I take that back. I totally fell into the Washington D.C. backdrop. If I had to recommend this book to a person I'd also tell them this: you can't stop at just one of her books.
Positive	A Very Suspenseful Book!: This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it.
Positive	This book was very good I loved the suspense: there wasn't enough romance though.I wish her books were longer
Negative	"A Disappointment: I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult.First the good things: the book has songs that not represented on prior play-alongs, including ""Harlem Nocturne"" ,""Opus One"" and ""Bernie's Tune"". Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On ""Harlem Nocturne"" and ""Desafinado"", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. ""A Night In Tunisia"" does not include the interlude before the break. ""Harlem Nocturne"" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there."""
Negative	Poor!: I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing! Just a lame tone to follow along with.
Positive	"Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' ""The Highwayman"" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like ""The Highwayman"" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Watch by Moonlight"". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."
Positive	A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book. It helped my find the right cage, told me about dangerous toys, first aid, different species, etc. This book contains everything, if you only want to buy one book on lovebirds, make it this one. This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection. I am looking forward to the arrival of my first baby lovebird, and because of this book, I feel confident and at ease that I can provide a safe and loving home for my bird.
Positive	Excellent book for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!
Positive	Good book for pet owners, but not breeders: If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)
Positive	Smooth and cool, like the anime series!: This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material. The dj (who speaks between songs) is odd, but kind of funny -- talking about old bands from the 2040s and cracks about Jabba the Hutt. If you enjoy smooth and tasteful lounge, as well as some danceable trance/ambient tunes this is probably an excellent buy for you. You might want to check your anime shop, before plunking down 30 bucks for it, but it will still be cash well spent.
Positive	"Vitaminless?: The version of this CD that includes ""Vitaminless"" is a bootleg. It'll be from ""Sonmay"" or ""Everanime"" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks."
Negative	Not woryh a plug nickle: Useless, just a junk kit. Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item. If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it, I would refuse it! Junk!
Negative	Not what it claimed to be: The pic was so small - couldn't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all. I didn't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses. How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses.
Negative	okay: the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. but i bought it to replace a cushion on my glasses. the screws are so small you can barely hold them in your fingers let alone secure it in place to try to screw it in,even with someone else helping me. you are better off getting your glasses repaired in a shop. but i do like the keychain.
Negative	Typical Imported Product: The case is pretty much useless. Nothing stays in the small compartments. I really dont know why they exist. The small screwdriver, both flathead & phillips are cheap material. You cant magnetize it in order to hold the screws which would make all the difference considering the size of the screws.
Positive	Nice kit: Everything you need to fix your glasses. Nice kit. Don't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits, you'll still be left with broken shades. Indulge (haha) in the 6 dollar kit and you'll be right as rain.
Negative	Screws do not have heads!: I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver. They looked loke little threaded rivets? No way to use them without a way to turn the screw. Quality rip off.
Positive	Must Have foer Anyone with Glasses or Sunglasses: I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses (won't buy expensive ones ever again) and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out. Everytime I needed a repair it was $5-$10 but with this kit, I do it myself and that was worth the money!
Negative	Doesn't smell like plumeria...unusable: This product smells disgusting, not like plumeria products I have bought. If you like plumeria, do not buy ... ... ... ...
Positive	Nice lighter version of Tresor: This is a nice lighter version of Tresor for the summer. I've enjoyed it, although it does not smell just like Tresor.
Positive	Good Enough I'm Looking for the Author: Help! My cousin in Brazil is trying to contact the author of this book. The letter he sent was returned to him as the address being no good. He had gotten the address out of the back of the book. Does anyone know how to contact the author?
Negative	Fox Collection: The Great Fox War Movies (Patton - Special Edition / The Longest Day / Tora! Tora! Tora! - Special Edition)I purchased this set and the DVD's (6) Were Damaged. I requested a replacement. The Replacement was also damaged. The problem is the DVD's are in paper inserts in the Book. They are not protected. In the packaging process by FOX ( Not Amazon ) The DVD's get all scratched and will not play.
Positive	Can't vouch for content, but packaging is really nice: As I said in the title, I can't vouch for the content as this was purchased as a gift for my Dad. However, the packaging is great. I thought Amazon made a mistake and sent a book instead of the DVD package, but it turned out to be BOTH a book and the DVD's (guess I should have read the description better). In any case, I know they are classic movies and this deluxe presentation will make an impressive gift.
Negative	Not the best deal...: Do yourself a favor and buy the special two disk editions of each of these movies separately. You won't get the book, but you'll save almost $50 off the price of this set. Unless of course the book is worth the extra fifty to you... It certainly isn't to me.
Positive	classic bit of entertainment: Adventure movie based on book, pretty much plot for plot. Set in Scotland, very late 60s, very cynical portrayals. And some stock pieces that have stuck in my memory clearly from when I first saw it in 1970. Holds its own, and the Wally Stott music hangs in the memory as well.
Negative	Not the best choice...: Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted.
Negative	AAARGH!: Avoid this game. I was gobsmacked to read the positive reviews on this game.There is little direction, you are left to wander about huge levels with chance bringing you across the necessary switch. The 4th level has caused me just to walk away from the game (Confluence). I cannot find a way out of the inital 3 levels. An online Game site I found said it was a bug so I downloaded an 80mb patch and had to replay from begining. Still no luck. Gamesite gave it 2.7 out of 10.The plot sounds great but is awful in reality - the script is like a 50's B movie and rather than guiding into suspicion about the Corporation ejects you into the Ressistance with the speed and elegance as a bad case of diorrea.I came across these reviews while trying to find BestBuys policy on returns of Software. ...
Negative	Worst 3D shooter I ever played: I paid $2 for this at Gamestop. It is worth about $-30, (yes, that is NEGATIVE $30), because I wasted three hours of my life. Most of that three hours was spent working as a JANITOR, where nothing fun is happening.Most of the game play is spent walking around in circles in empty areas looking for the correct way out. Very boring. Enemies are not fun to fight. My favorite was the huge level with invisible enemies. How fun is it to spend hours going over the same layout again and again while looking for INVISIBLE creatures.This could be the worst game I ever played.Yes, I was stuck forever at the eco-dome, because there the door out wouldn't open. I think that might have been the bug referred to earlier.Do not buy this game.
Positive	To the point: Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it's a thick book - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e.g. classic Nordic skis or 3-pin tele's. Alpine riders seeking vertical ft look for George Hurchalla's book.
Negative	A disappointment: This is not a good atlas at all. Maps are small and you can't find many of the cities, let alone small towns in europe, at least in southeastern europe. Waste of money.
Positive	WIll work with new drivers: My brother and I have had to split our time on the internet for a while. (He has a desktop which uses an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, while I have a laptop which requires the ethernet cable to be plugged into an airport) So for Christmas, I decided to give him a gift that would please me as well, this wireless adapter. The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work. Finally, my brother found some way to install new drivers for the PCI card. After he did this, it worked fine. I hope this review helps anyone that might be having similar troubles.
Positive	Not ready for Windows seven: Had great connection and was REALLY fast. It was not ready for windows 7 tho, it doesn't has the drive for it yet!
Positive	Works Great: I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great.
Positive	A little trouble connecting but works fine: I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. It took me over an hour to finally connect, but I don't think this is the fault of the product, just my computer. I have been connected for about 5 minutes now and it works great =). The signal's good (I'm 40 or 50 ft from the wireless router and signal strength jumps between 91% and 95%) and It's about just as fast as my other computer with a physical internet connection. I would recommend it if you're looking for something cheap that works.
Positive	Really good value for the money: I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don't currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem.I picked this card based on the rating and reviews here. I am happy to say that they were very accurate and this is a really good card, especially given that the price is so low compared to other, brand name cards.Installation was very simple and the signal strength and speed are perfect. I was in a hurry so I just used the Windows wireless client instead of the dedicated, included software but perhaps if I get time later, I will try running that.All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this card - right price and very good performance.
Positive	Satisfied Customer: I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house. I'm surprised that I get 75-80 percent signal strength from where I am, which was way less that my last one that had the small antenna attached directly to the pci card. All I can say is the price and the product are both awesome.
Positive	Vista Home Premium 64-bit SP1 easy install: After reading past reviews, I was prepared to have to download special 64-bit drivers to make this card work with Vista 64-bit. But they weren't needed: Vista 64 automatically got the drivers from Windows Update, and I was connected to my WPA network in minutes. Never needed the MSI installation disk or the drivers I'd downloaded.Card itself works find, excellent signal strength. The little antenna is fine, although I may wind up velco-ing it to the case.
Positive	Stable and fast!: I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts. Works great on my 64-bit system. There are no cons to this card. Buy it while it is still available. Other sites are out of stock!!!!
Positive	leet product: This thing can pick up signals better than anything I have used. It gets a better signal than the Linksys or Buffalo router functioning as a wireless bridge (via DD-WRT or Tomato). Installation is just like any other windows device. Extremely stable connection even with crappy routers.
Positive	Easiest route I have ever installed!: I noted the opinions of previous raters of this product and decided to give it a try.Not only was delivery fantastically quick, but the wireless card installed instantly and required no configuration by me! So nice to buy something that installs easily and works well.
Positive	Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...: Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating.
Positive	Works Good.: I Bought this card for a third computer in my house and its the ferthest from the router and works fine.
Positive	"Fastest so far!: Bought this to install in a 40 Gig, HP Pentium 4 hard drive government surplus computer that is about 2-3 years old. Other than having trouble connecting it with my QWest wireless service (it wouldn't show in the little box they kept telling me to click on even though the wireless card properties said ""the device is working properly""), I got it to connect anyway and this computer now has the fastest internet in the house! It is faster than my brand new Dell that I got last year. I am recommending it to my parents who bought similar surplus computers after seeing how fast the internet was on this computer. I don't think it is the computer though, I think it is the wireless card! It was easy to install, too (and I have never installed anything in a tower before). I am very pleased with it, esp. for the price!"
Negative	Weak Signal: I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!
Positive	GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!: This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome.
Negative	did not work: The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
Positive	Very Fast Wireless Card: I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. With the computer in the same room as my wireless card I don't even need to use the antenna. I am very impressed and it has worked flawlessly for me.
Positive	Works with Vista 64: I loaded this up today and out of the box it did not work with vista 64, I had to go on another computer and go to MSI's website to get the vista 64 drivers. Once I had those I ran them and the card works great. Only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 is because while using this to game I lag for about 1 second every couple of minutes, it's just enough to be a pain.
Positive	"Works with XP 64!!!!: I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. I tried two different USB devices and three different PCI devices and none of them worked until this product. What a great price too. I put it in loaded the software and BAM! it work perfectly. Very cool how some thing just work and for about one third the price of all those other devices that I tried. My only complaint would be the 18"" external antenna. I wish it was one of the folding ones that comes attached. Oh well.... I'm just happy to be finished and not have to return any more stuff because it doesn't work."
Positive	Works great: This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
Positive	Works Great!: This little card installs flawlessly on Windows 7 and then just works like a champ. Great connectivity while connecting to a Linksys WRT54G from a fairly difficult location (downstairs and across the house!). Very happy with it, especially at this price,
Positive	Easy to install...cheaper than buying directly from Dell!: This card is a breeze to install, fits right into the slot in my Dell PC. Dell was asking for $50 for pretty much the same card, preinstalled. Saved a bundle. Couldn't be happier. No issues with Windows, no problems with connection speed. Certainly recommend this product.
Positive	Good product. Recommended.: This works as well as the other reviewers suggested. Easy installation if you've opened up your cpu before and exchanged a pci card before. The antenna has good range, and I was connected in minutes to my wireless router. Thanks a lot.
Positive	Reliable, Fast, and Inexpensive.: I've burned through 4 different types of USB Internet dongles and a few PCMCIA cards of all brands. Only one dongle works now and it's from Trendnet. So I decided to go with PCI cards for wireless internet. The first one I got was for my wife. It was a good deal until they doubled the price when I needed a few more. Trolling Amazon I went. After reading all of the reviews, I settled on this card. I purchased two and they work flawlessly. One is connected 24/7 to the Internet, my daughter can't miss a beat with Club Penguin, and the other runs an FTP server 24/7. I have had them for a while now, at least 6 months or so, and they work a lot better than most of the USB dongles I've had. I have no issues uploading or downloading huge files from FTP to my HTTP server.It was a good buy.
Positive	Great Wireless PCI card: It is a wonderful and for the price, nothing can beat it.I had other USB adapters installed before and never have great reception as this does.Highly recommend.The MSI software needs a little attention but if you follow the procedures, you should be fine. Took no more than 15 minutes to get every thing ironed out.
Negative	"Incompatible with windows7: OK, I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. The official website doesn't have a driver for windows 7. It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur. Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router, but 80% of the time, the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is ""server not found"". It's on its way back to amazon. If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it's out, avoid this card as best as you can."
Negative	antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION
Negative	Not Worth It: This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. I have an HP and the connector plates don't line up either. Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects. It does not work.
Negative	Doesn't work: This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
Negative	DO NOT BUY!: 1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
Negative	Keeps dropping the connection.: I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon.
Positive	Works great on Vista 64-bit: NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network.Didn't even need the enclosed drivers. Vista 64-bit connected the device without a hitch and it's been working flawlessly for about 1 year.EDIT 09/24/2011This device also works great with Linux Ubuntu 10.04...
Negative	crc receive errors: Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location, I was convinced that the problem was the adapter. I installed another adapter , linksys, that worked immediately. Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access, but it was not strong enough for my environment. I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution.
Positive	Significant improvement over my USB wireless: I had a USB wireless adapter that got 50-60% signal strength. This this adapter, I get around 90%. I've absolutely no problems with this card and have been impressed by it's performance.
Positive	"works well: does as advertised. Bought this because of current reviews and it's great. I have to ""repair"" the connection about once every 2 weeks on the machine being used with this card, but I never have to repair the connection on my other computer. Not sure why this is, but it's a really fast fix and never causes problems."
Positive	Works as advertised: Good product, works just as described. Easy to install. Have not had any problems thus far.
Positive	Simple Installation: I received and installed this last night on my kids 4 year old HP desktop. It is a replacement for the Buffalo wireless USB adapter the kids broke a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to get a replacement Buffalo product but found that a court injunction now bars Buffalo from selling many of their products in the US.I installed the Super G and it interfaced with the Buffalo router in 30 seconds. No problem at all. It even receives pretty good signals from 5 other wireless networks in my neighborhood. I am no computer geek but will say this product works like a charm with no dropped signals so far.
Positive	Excellent signal: A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice.
Positive	Talk about plug and play!: I have windows Vista to start with. Installation took all of 5 minutes. I installed the software that came with the product and could not get my PC to recognize the card installed in an empty PCI slot. Went to the manufactures website and sure enough, they had the new software upgrade for VISTA. Installed it and was online instantly. It seems as fast as direct cable hook up. Worth every penny. A great product...
Positive	Works great with Windows 7: Just got this card for my new Windows 7 machine. Worked great after I got the RA link drivers from their website. Seems fast, doesn't lose connections, the antenna seems sturdy. Right now only using it with 802.11b but it seems fast enough!
Positive	Works great!: I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn't dropped signal on me yet
Negative	Does not work with Windows Vista & Airport: Tried and failed to get my pc set up on our Airport 802.11g network. Vista did not recognize the card; XP recognized the card but would only let me join the network when we turned security off. I'm sure that this is a Windows problem more than it is the fault of the wireless card, but still--couldn't get this product to work and now we have to buy another card.
Positive	Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2: I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!
Positive	Works Great!: I had a Linksys wireless receiver that was not compatible with Vista, so after upgrading my computer, I found this on Amazon and based on reviews, decided to give it a shot. Worked wonderful right out of the box, and signal strength is excellent! Works like a champ, and easy to install. Highly recommend if you need a Vista compatible connection to your wireless router.
Positive	Works great: I added this to my windows vista desktop. It seems to work fine. I have been using it for months.
Negative	lost settings: Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days.
Negative	Total garbage! Software terrible. No support. Don't buy!: I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G.
Negative	Works, but with limitations.: This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card.
Positive	Works great: This product works really good. My computer is pretty far from any connection, yet it still connects great, and is usually very fast.
Positive	It works!: I bought this because my crappy D-link wireless pci adapter was dying only after about 6 months into use. It was dropping connections every 10 minutes or so. Now after I plug this in, I get at least 4 bars compared to average 2-3 bars i used to get with d-link. I saw some users complain about the short antenna. Yes it is pretty short but long enough to get on top of the computer and that alone can make whole lot of difference. Otherwise spend little more money and get more expensive ones. For this price, this one is a steal. Also to anyone who bought/will buy this item. Do yourself a favor, dont use the crappy driver that comes with it. Go to ralink website and download their reference driver.
Negative	Very Dissapointed: This is a book that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Great Pictures of Bassets. And then it is a general dog Information Book.I was looking for a Book that would be much more specific about Basset Hounds and not a product catalog.
Negative	Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets.
Negative	Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset.

Negative	Waste of money: This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. The maps are the worst part of it, you can either look at a small general state map or zoom to a trail map NOTHING in-between. If you want to find trails (and don't know the trail name) you have to guess on the state which only lists major cities. All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK. My advice is save your money and use the internet because there are many hiking web sites that have the same or more trail information and are a lot easier to use.
Positive	DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!: this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. i live in california so im not sure if they have circuit city's anywhere else.
Positive	Great product: This is a great product for the price. For a home theater aplication this amp does more than expected. And for the price you just can ask anymore. I got this amp shipped very quickly and received it without any problems all the way in Aruba! The amp has a bunch of preset EQ's so you'll find one that'll fit you. I run these through old but faithfull Pinnacle 200 monitors and some RCA surrounds and the whole set just begs to be played out loud. It's been a while since I felt rumble in the room from such a deep bass. I think it's part amp part speakers. If you match them correctly you won't go wrong.
Positive	Outdated but Great for Essays, Papers, and Editing: I value this book since I proofread papers, essays, administrative memos, etc. for clients on liveperson.com and in past careers. This helps for office filing, clerical/administrative basics if you are working on these type of jobs/duties required. I also recommend this book for editing projects and for reference for college papers.
Positive	a valuable resource: if you need to have clarity regarding the usage of the written word, this book will be a valuable, easy to use reference.
Positive	Simply the best: I teach business writing in industry and government, and I recommend the Gregg Manual enthusiastically in all my programs, at every level. There are a lot of wonderful resources out there, including Albert Joseph's classic EXECUTIVE GUIDE TO GRAMMAR, that can help you understand what makes our language tick, but there is nothing like Gregg when you need an authoritative answer NOW to a specific (even picayune) question. And it's striking to see how EXCITED seemingly well-balanced people from all walks of life can be when they first get their hands on Gregg. After reading the other reviews here, I am even preparing to do the unthinkable and buy a new copy - just to see what the new edition has to say about computers (my copy is a little old...).
Positive	Book review: great book a lot better than I excepted. It is now being used in class. quick shipping. very happy. looking for more from that author and related material.
Positive	An invaluable style and reference manual for advertising copywriters: This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. There may be a new edition that supercedes this one by the time you read this. if so, I would buy it without reservation. I find myself reaching for this time and again when I write. Highly recommended.
Positive	Simply the Best!: Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch.
Negative	Boo! Stay away from this product: Such a great idea, perfect in its simplicity, and yet executed so horribly. This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review on Amazon (I was so worked up I even took pictures and added them to the product description).1. The tactile feel of the product sucks. The buttons should click or at least depress nicely.2. Murky, hard to read numbers. Even when I push down all the way some numbers are still barely legible and I wonder if my daughter will be able to depress the buttons all the way.3. Some of the math is wrong! 1 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 3? This isn't exactly advanced vector calculus and it's THE ONLY THING this product is supposed to do. At least do it right. Even if the company realized the mistake after one million units were produced, they should have the pride to not ship a math product geared exclusively towards kids learning math with bad math on it.1 star, avoid.
Negative	Hard to see answers under buttons: I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.
Positive	Perfect for a first grader: great for a child just learning basic math concepts. has really helped my first grader gain an edge with math facts
Positive	No batteries calculator!: My husband had these as a kid. If you push the buttons down, the answer becomes visable through the plastic. Durable and great for our kids to practice math with.
Positive	Use product in bright light: I bought this toy for my daughter, I remember playing with this at a cousins house as a child. Although, I don't remember having a hard time seeing the numbers as a child. I found that it is best to used to product over a light.. if possible, or in a well lit area. I THINK THE PRODUCT COULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WERE A MINI LIGHT BUILT IN THE BACK OF THE GAME.Durable and fun though.
Positive	Great learning toy!: Bought this for my niece, as I had one similar as a child and she loves it as much as I did! It's a fun way to learn addition and subtraction!
Negative	Plus-Minus Chart Toy: Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above.
Negative	"Useless: I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
Negative	out of stock?: When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else. very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again.
Negative	Arrogant Author: I found that the style of the book was more about the author showing off his knowlege, rather than presenting the information. There are few examples, and the ones that are there, are poorly explained. There is a severe lack of organization - he just seems to spew information. At times he shows us his humor - not very funny, but the most readable part of the book.He spends too much time bashing C and C++. (Does he think it makes him look smart?) I want to learn Java, not compare it to other languages and think how great I am for using it (like he does). One has to know C++ to understand what he's saying. In general, if you know already OOP and C++ this book will be good for you, otherwise STAY AWAY!!!
Negative	AWESOME Writer - Not updated for all of Java2...: Rushed to press, not all of the Java2 API is included in this volume. I loved Java 1.1 and Beyond, but I wasted my money on this one...
Negative	ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER: I got this book for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. I hate this book! Maybe some people who have a little background would like it better.
Negative	It is pretty bad: I am a computer Science student at the university of new brunswick and i felt that this book was a complete waste of time. The author would introduce new topics and then jump into rather difficult examples with very little explanations. I would recommend that anybody interested in learning java to not buy this book.
Negative	"A good source of propaganda!: I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
Positive	"Great book - easy learning: I loved ""Just Java 2"", and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Unlike what one other reviewer wrote, there is no assumption of C++ (It amazes me that people who read a book so superficially feel free to share their wrong assumptions about it). Just Java 2 is well written and easy to follow. The examples are interesting, and the source, the Java FAQ, and a wealth of other info and compilers is on the accompanying CD. Highly recommended!"
Negative	"Vague: This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
Negative	Lacks depth.: This book does not treat any topic in detail. If you just want to skim through Java concepts at 10,000 feet this is the correct book for you. The print is very sparse with lots of not very useful (rather large) images.I got mis-guided by all those 5-Star reviewes.
Negative	"I am surprised this book is endorsed by SUN: This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter ""FILE I/O"", after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."
Negative	"Not Practical: This book leaves much to be desired. Take the chapter called ""All About Applets"" for example. It briefly covers how browser and applets interact, parameter passing, key applet methods, and jar files, but it does not put together a cohesive, clear, practical example in the whole chapter. The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled. This book had a 4 1/2 star rating this book had when I ordered it (with many reviews), and it's definitely not deserving of the 4 star rating it has now."
Negative	Its little hard..: The way he used to explain the topics are confusing..I was very excited to buy this book but found it difficult instead of having C and C++ knowledge.
Positive	Great book...the best one I looked at.: Explanations are clear and concise....which is what I needed. Includes sample code to illustrate points made.
Negative	NOT so good: Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly.
Positive	The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book.
Positive	Just Java 2: Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow.
Positive	"Not as good as his book ""Deep C Secrets"": I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled ""Deep C Secrets"" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level."
Positive	Great book for existing programmers: This book is great for people (like me) who can already program, and just want to learn Java. I found it went at the right pace to get me the info I needed on Java. Most examples are small enough to understand easily, with much bigger ones inc. complete games & applications on the CD. Highly recommended if you want to learn Java, and already know C or Fortran or VB etc
Positive	Excellent intro to Java and OOP for newbies.: I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail.
Negative	"Do not buy this book unless you know C++: I thought I'd be able to learn Java from this book, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the author attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java.I found the book condescending to non C and C++ programmers, and the order of subjects he chooses to teach Java is wierd.If you want to learn Java and don't know C or C++, do not look here, go to Dietel and Deitel's ""Java: How to Program"" instead."
Negative	"Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this book should have been, ""Java for C/C++ Programmers"". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, ""In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte."" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is ""Core Java, Vol 1"", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."
Negative	Not a very thorough book: This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language.
Negative	Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book.
Negative	very cryptic details: not suited for beginner's should have qiute lucid explationsi dont recommend for new commers to java
Negative	"very bad book: The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book ""core java 2"" is much better."
Negative	Not for true beginners: I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!
Negative	"Please dont buy if you are entirely new to Java Concepts: Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - ""If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO..."" is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."
Positive	A Reader from Fremont, CA (near San Francisco).: Just Java 1.2 thought me a lot about programmings. First I used Core Java but now, I like Just Java 1.2 better. JUST JAVA RULES!
Negative	Don't waste your hard-earned money: This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do.
Positive	Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book.
Negative	Easy to read, but NOT a good reference: Just Java 2 is very readable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. I'd read a chapter and feel like I had a fairly complete understanding. But when I tried to apply what I learned, I always struggled. The problem for me was his examples are way too fragmented and incomplete. I spend lots of time reviewing FAQ sites for descent examples.I would not recommend this book.FYI - I am new to OOP, but relatively experienced with C, ADA, Fortran, ...
Negative	"Great for C Gurus...: The back cover mentions it is a book for people with ""programming backgrounds"". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is ""C/C++ expertise"". If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like ""you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference."" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."
Positive	Great Activity Book - Cover Questionable: This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking.
Negative	Cheaply made: Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
Positive	"I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
Positive	Costly but good: This trainning pad is the most absorbant I've ever seen. It also attracts your pooch and can be soiled via urine a couple of times before being discarded. You never seem to smell urine and never have to worry about leakage however it is very costly. I have found pads that are much cheaper with slightly less of a quality. After paying high prices for this brand for over a year my eyes are begining to rove to the lesser costly brand.
Positive	"Excellent movie, poor quality DVD, poor quality video: My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship. You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an ""OK"" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the ""extra"" information isn't. The ""shame on you"" goes to The Richard Diercks Company, Inc., and Simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of ""what not to do"" in DVD production, development, and video transfer."
Positive	More than just music: This is one of the best Christian music CDs you can ever find in the music industry. Christian music is different from secular music, and the difference is that Christian musicians are there to praise God, instead of praising themselves for their talent, and to guide listeners' heart and mind to God through music. And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life. It is more than just beautiful. Too bad, there is only 5 stars to rate her. I would give her 10 stars!
Positive	Great CD, Great Artist!: This CD is one that you will never get tired of. Jennifer's talent and sound are incredible. She is one of the most gifted artist's I've ever listened to. I would recommend this CD to anyone and have already bought it as a gift for most of my acquaintances.
Positive	Jennifer LaMountain: Listening to Jennifer's message and voice is very promising to me! It lift's up my thought's and makes me look foward to our real home with Jesus in Heaven! Beautiful words and music!
Positive	"Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,"" which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the ""happy ending"" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."
Negative	Did not learn much: Instant Immersion French is poor when it comes to teaching you French. I was just unable to learn from this program unlike some other programs which have helped me. Beware this product, I would consider a different company's product over this one. I have also tried French Now by Transparent Language and found that it taught me French quite well.
Negative	Really should be zero stars: This product is really a disappointment. There are no menus and no lessons one, two, etc. On CD 1 you learn some basic words and then on CD 2 there is nothing but French. The other CDs are not much more help. I bought this program to learn French and now I'm considering not wasting my time, trashing it and starting again.
Negative	Worthless: It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this
Negative	Next time read the item description Edgardo: This is not a book so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer's works. There is nothing of value here. Read the Pursuit of God by Tozer if you you want something to challenge you and guide you, not this.
Negative	If you like Tozer, you won't like this!: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!
Positive	"This CD is Great!: I have this CD! I like ""Adventure Heart~Davis's theme~""and number17 music,number1 song. Number1 song'sJapanese title is""Target~Akaishougeki~"" Number17'sJapanese title is ""Kenchan..wormmonnotheme."" This music is my favorititeits. Number17music is like a Japanesemusic""Kamatakousinkyoku"" I think very similar.but I like very much!(^-^) I recommend this CD! Tonikaku osusume! ..sorry..this sentence is strenge..and funny!(T-T) sorejya situreisimasu~! Emi"
Positive	"Sorry!: I mistaked review sentence!(T-T) I correct a mistakes! Music number17 is not ""Kenchan..wormmonnotheme"". Correct number is 12!! I'm sorry..(T-T) This CD is Saiko-!!(excellent)"
Negative	baaaaaadddddddd bookkkkkkk: por favor no gaste su dinero en este pesimo y mediocre libro,,lo unico que la mujer y el chino hacen es mostrar su impresionante flexibilidad,pero nada mas,,no aportan tecnicas reales ni explicaciones para llegar a ese estado.me parece mas bien que los autores lo que quieren es que la gente sepa que ellos tienen una super-flexibilidad impresionante.este es solamente un librito y nada mas,, muy,,muy pero muy mediocre
Positive	My cat loves them !!!: What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
Positive	"A Good New Irish (Rock) Group: If you're interested in Celtic or Irish music these guys out Kansas will get your foot dancing, and beyond! The other good CD from them is American Wake. Great music to get you ""wild and crazy"" some night because they don't slow down with many of their songs. Not old Celtic music, but there are enough of a taste to please any purist. Give it a try!"
Positive	Bloody Brilliant !: Was introduced to the lads by my daughter, Lindy. They performed in Cheyenne, Wyo last summer (looks like they'll be back this year too (can you see me smiling? ) I saw them last September in Estes Park, and they are brilliant ! Their upbeat numbers will get your feet tapping, your hands clapping and your heart pounding. My favourite, however, is a much slower one: Men of Erin,, it'll give you goose bumps and bring a tear to your eye,,,, We love ya, lads,,,, Slainte !
Negative	not sufficient after a long day at the computer: I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
Positive	The Hound of Baskerville: The book is what I would call an intriguing tease. Doyle creates a mood throughout the whole book that keeps the reader sitting on the edge of their seat. I would definitely recommend this book for those readers who like a good mystery.
Negative	Missing content is not acceptable - Wake up, Amazon!: Missing content is not acceptable for publishing books, either paper version or digital version! Please fix the problem, Amazon!!!!
Negative	Missing Content: this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
Negative	Excellent Book; Terrible Kindle Version: The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers. There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories. In a complete version, it's a four-star book.
Positive	A nice abridgement: These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks. It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive. My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete. Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it.
Positive	"The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!: I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. ""The Red-Headed League"" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY! (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case)."
Positive	Like Finding an Old Friend: I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old.
Positive	Lasts a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is one of the best. It has lasted over a century, having been published in 1901. If you haven't read it, do so today--there haven't been many changes in detective fiction in the last hundred years.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.
Positive	Male only spaces: I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times.
Positive	"The Hound of the Baskervilles: The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection. We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book. The book itself is, of course, a ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people. The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text."
Positive	Top Rate Holmes..........: Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!
Negative	The Hound of the Baskervilles: This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library.
Negative	Missing substantial passages on Kindle version: I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete.
Negative	The Hound of the Baskervilles MP's story!!!: I liked the book because I like murder mysteries and if you like that kinda stuff this is a book for you! But it gets boring because you have like 14 pages a chapter basically about noghting. Also I like this book because it's got non-other than Shelock Holmes the greatest detective in book history.In the beginning it does get intresting. But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects. But he also follows them and decides if he thinks they murdered the person or not? Setting is next the setting is in London. They make it sound really scary where they are at Baskerville Hall where the heir of Sir Charles Basketville who died left to his nephew.
Negative	"Paranormal forces in my mystery?: I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."
Negative	The Hound: The name of my book is Hound of The Baskervilles. In this book the main character is sir Charles Baskervilles. He is a very important man then one night he dies. But he was found dead out side during his evening walk. So it is up to Sherlock Holmes to find out if this was caused to natural causes or it was rough play. Sherlock has little time to solve the mystery before chaless nephew receives his place as a rich tycoon.Idid not like this book and do not suggest this to anyone.
Negative	Hard to read: This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle. I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.
Negative	BAD BOOK!: this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!
Negative	"Nothing superb about Holmes.: ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
Positive	Howllllllll: My grandaughter needed this book for school. Instead of trying to find one in the book stores, I had her download it on her Kindle. Fast, easy and it made me look good to my grandaughter. The purchase was a bargain at $0.99. She reviewed the book, got an A on the assignment and all is well in Houston.....Buy a Kindle...download book assignments and be a hero to your family.m
Positive	great!: very good book. read it for school, but it was definitely worth it to read it. good story line that kept me interested through all the plot twists
Positive	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve: I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now.
Negative	Where's the rest?: I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing! All the poems in Alice in Wonderland as well as Through the Looking Glass and now the manuscript in Baskervilles.Either the free editions are poorly edited before release (if indeed they are proofread at all) or (more likely) Amazon is releasing an incomplete product for free in order to force us to buy one of their fancy versions. I might understand if this were an author who is still around, but with the classics I think this is unacceptable.
Negative	great story - but don't buy this version!!: This is one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes tales, and I was thrilled that it could be acquired so cheaply for my Kindle. However, whenever a character reads out loud from a newspaper or other document, the passage being read is missing from this Kindle edition. As such, information vital to the tale is missing. Terrible! Spend more money, and get a comprehensive (and comprehensible!) version.
Negative	Read This First!!!!!!!!!: okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!
Negative	Buy from a different publisher!: There are key parts of this book missing. I was so confused about the story until I realized this. Get the book from a different publisher.
Negative	Missing Text!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I agree with the previous reviewer. I had begun reading the story from a book and had reached the end of chapter 2. Back at home I loaded the free version on my Kindle and found that not only was the legend of the baskervilles that the client reads to Holmes missing, but the more recent newspaper account as well. Pay the two dollars and get the complete book. Who knows how much else is missing.
Positive	"The Hounds of the Baskervilles criticism: The story was a little uneasy at first, but the action and plot and all that good stuff kicks in. Seems to me, just one of those ""you have to get into the plot sort of books"" I'd recommend it to all, who would like to get into the Sherlock Holmes universe for the first time..."
Negative	Let down in literature: All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery.
Positive	"Enhanced with music and sound effects: The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
Positive	"chris's review: this was one of shelocks best books. this book was suspenceful,exicting, mysterious and shocking. in this book all kind of things happen,i mean think about it ok, your in 1814 and your dad has been atacked by a ""hell hound"" so you think his son has just enherited his mancion and his money. she he calls sherlock holmes to find out what happend to his father, and as he gets to start looking around the place he finds that the father had another son but did not knew about it. this son was even living on the property, and this son was the killer becuse he whanted to have the manchion. the conflict is great, we have person vs.person, person vs.nature, person vs.animal. this was a great book just to read, allways had surprises and suspence, it was a great mystery."
Negative	Good book, bad copy.: My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story.
Negative	"Its OK: I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
Positive	This is the definition of mystery genre. Doyle at his best.: This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed
Negative	Useless: This edition is missing all passages in which a character is reading a letter or article, which is essential to the story. This edition is useless and needs to be removed from Amazon or corrected.
Negative	missing content: I am very excited about reading this book but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. I was really disappointed with ths version and am seeking another version to download. Amazon please fix this ASAP. Sir Doyle would be appauled.
Negative	Missing passages: For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound. I don't know if it's just a technical glitch because I'm using the Kindle software on my Mac or there is something else going on. Doesn't seem to be much point in having a book with parts of the story missing.
Negative	Mising Information/Incomplete: This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost.
Negative	Missing Passages: Note: this is a review is specific for theThe Hound of the Baskervillesedition and not the book as a whole. The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book. If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone. Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version.
Negative	Passages missing: This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues.
Negative	Great story... but not on the kindle: I read a review for a free version of this for the kindle that suggested you spend a buck or two to get a decent copy. Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars. There have to be better versions out there, though.
Negative	Missing text.: Just wanted to agree with the other reviewers that this version is useless. I ended up getting a free version of this book from Project Gutenberg.
Positive	Holmes Fan Created: This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!
Positive	"Not so mysterious, but a great setting: Although it didn't have enough suspects to be as ""mysterious"" as some of the other Sherlock Holmes stories I've read (the ""big reveal"" of the villain was not surprising at all), this one was still a fun read.My favorite part about the book was the atmosphere. I wonder if the moor where most of the book is set is a real place. If so, I want to visit. Rocky tors, misty swamps, ancient dwellings made from stone, and the occasional large stately mansion. I'm ready to buy my plane ticket to London."
Negative	"Missing Critical Text!: This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
Negative	Missing parts: I concur with previous reviews. Unacceptable copy as it is mising passages - as mentioned before - which creates the most confusion from the very start. Should be removed from the Amazon catalog as it is unbecoming of this vendor. SAVE YOUR TIME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.
Positive	"The Best ""Hound"" Ever: This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
Negative	Don't bother downloading this copy: As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text.
Negative	Hound of the Baskervilles: This edition is missing THE main plot of the story. Every time there is a letter or a newspaper article that is read (which anyone who reads Sherlock Holmes knows is a common device), it is skipped in the text entirely. This isn't even a good deal for free!
Negative	Kindle version is missing text that is central to the story: This Kindle version is missing huge portions of text.For example, the entire manuscript read in Chapter 2 is missing.Amazon: please fix it or remove this defective version.
Negative	Missing passages ruin great story: This is a great story, but as others have already noted, this Kindle version is missing numerous passages. This leaves the reader without important information needed to understand the plot. Get a different version!
Negative	"Defective Kindle edition--critical info missing!: If Amazon would have let me, I would have rated it *no* stars. This Kindle version of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" has a huge flaw: every time a character reads aloud from a text, that text is omitted from this edition. Here is an actual quote from my Kindle:""Dr. Mortimer [. . .] read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative ...""Considering that the omitted passages include the actual legend of the Hound, as well as the account of the death that brought the client to Holmes, this renders the story unreadable. Sadly, it looks like you get what you pay for in this instance..."
Negative	Defective version of great story: As others have pointed out, this version is missing critical portions that totally ruin one of the greatest mysteries in the English language. Free is generally good, but not in this case.
Positive	"One of the All-Time Classics!: Sherlock Holmes is at his best every time you read it, and this newly-published edition is no different. The 2009 edition is well-edited, and well-presented, and the story is timeless. If you have read ""Sherlock Holmes"" in the past, it should take no convincing as to why you should read it again. If you have never read this book, then you need to purchase this today and enjoy the amazing story that the rest of us have been enjoying for years. This novel also makes a fantastic gift for those of our younger generations that have never had the pleasure of enjoying Sherlock Holmes in all of his glory.Please enjoy this book, and share it with your friends and family!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" series, and the newly-published ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
Negative	Not network friendly: We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit.
Positive	printer: it is a very good printer I give it only 4 star becauce if I want to print more than on page on a row it has long delay between pages, it prints fast
Positive	Print This: I was a bit concerned about my first network device but this one was just plug and go. Worked first try and we now have a silent ( it's not in my office)fast, reliable printer.
Negative	Will not work with PrintServers: I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer. Problem is the HP Laserjet 1020 doesn't work with either the Netgear or Linksys Printservers which boggles the mind. My customer wan't happy and neither am I.
Positive	The Vedic Path: This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. My friend, whose birthday present it was, was enchanted, and used it for meditation, excercise, and to create a peaceful ambience for writing. The vocals are evocative and ethereal without being repetitive or simplistic. I would recommend.
Positive	Love this record book: It is simple enough that I don't feel like I'm scrapbooking (because who has time with a toddler and a newborn) but has a lot of fill in the blanks and page suggestions that keep me on track. I say suggestions because you could easily cover the prompts with more pictures and write other information on some of the pages. I have one for my daughter and my son. The color is NOT pinkish as it seems in the picture, it is a light orange gingham.
Positive	A treasure: Thsi book is the greatest. I really covers everything baby would want to know when she gets older. My warning is that you better start writing the minute you get it or you can miss important days as you get so busy when baby is born. Try to get this item before baby is born so that you can acquaint yourself with the information you will need to enter. GET IT!!! My only regret is that one day after I bought it my sister bought me one so I could have saved that cash. My sister returned it.
Positive	Fantastic: I recently purchased this memory book for one of my sisters who is expecting her first baby soon and she was so grateful. She loved it and now I am considering buying more for other relatives who are expecting..
Positive	"Beware!: Readers should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as ""Emilio's Carnival."" Don't be fooled by the classy NYRB edition; the usually impeccable editors of that series have passed this ""vintage"" translation into print with nary a warning. Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems. For more information on de Zoete as a translator, see William Weaver's excellent introduction to his wonderful translation of ""Zeno's Conscience,"" which nicely dispatches de Zoete's ""The Confessions of Zeno"" to the dustheap of translation history."
Positive	Passion: Very good about passion in a Proustian way. Is marked by country: Italy, and age. Complicated task by a writer tofollow different persons thoughts over time. This is Svevo's art.
Positive	Great CD: This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd's that are not english. All of the songs on it are great. I am not new to this form of music anymore so if you are new to this form of music and are a Sailor Moon fan like me. This would be a very good buy. ;}
Positive	"just beautiful.: This is one of my favorite albums. The score for this film was extrodinary and the original music performed by Deborah Lurie was absolutely gorgeous.The top 5 songs of the soundtrack:1. ""It's Alright"" by Peace Out featuring Chris Logan (Black Sabbath cover)2. ""Tim's Song"" - Deborah Lurie3. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" - Postal Service4. ""Baby Hold On"" - Nina Khoury5. ""Waterfall"" - I-94This is the very best cover of ""It's Alright"" I've ever heard. Guns N Roses tried it once but this one is slightly better. It's a beautiful song and was a fantastic choice for this movie. The lyrics and overall sound of the song fit the story and pace of the music perfectly. So kudos to them for choosing to re-record it."
Negative	Warning for other buyers: I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap...
Positive	Stunning!: I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price.
Negative	"""Where is the Jazz?"": I keep reading the reviews here touting this disc for it's ""jazziness"". Needless to say, I am NOT impressed with Ms. Dulfer's lame attempt to overlay her vocals to ""background jazz"" riffs. She is a much better player than this and she is now developing ""Ronnie Laws disease"" - where you believe that vocals are your bread & butter.There are a couple of fine cuts on this disc worth mentioning - specifically ""December""; ""Valdez In The Country""; and the last song ""Lost and Gone"". How ironic....this should probably also be the title of the disc!!!Hopefully, the next disc will provide a more fruitful listening experience. For unadulterated Dulfer Funk - check out ""Live in Amsterdam""....you won't be disappointed."
Positive	Jungle antics in two languages: Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!
Negative	Horrible Service: Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
Positive	New Wave Review: I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. I just purchased a New Wave replacement cartridge for my 2nd year of use. I love that they remind you that it is time to replace the cartridge. I feel I am doing something good for my family with a minimum amount of money. It's worth it.
Positive	EXCELLENT!: My tap water is so chlorinated that my eyes would burn and my skin would itch when I got out of the shower. For a year I searched for a filter that would not just remove the chlorine odor but actually remove the chlorine! Could not find one until I discovered Enviro. I finally take showers with clean non poisonous water and gases and I'm thrilled. I also got a counter top water filter and its wonderful also since I had been purchasing bottled water before that. Just note that after a while the shower head will start to not remove the chlorine as much so you have to start thinking of replacing it but its a gradual process depending on how often the shower is used and to be expected, so I order a replacement and hold onto it until I feel its ready to change out.
Positive	great shower filter: It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. I would definitely recommend this filter for anyone. It is very reasonable priced considering how long each filter lasts and is very effective.
Positive	Good product but.....: Enviro shower chlorine filter is an excellent product. The first time I used it I saw a considerable difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I was so pleased to find out there was a replacement cartridge available for less than half the price of the whole filter. What I don't like about this product is that it leaks. Even after several attempts to reinstall it, it still leaked. Finally, we patched it up with some type of shower tape. And guess what: it still leaks.So I would give five stars for the whole filter but not for the replacement product although it does such a good job of removing chlorine.
Negative	Don't waste your money on this one!: While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD.
Positive	More than just John Wayne.: It was funny to see Shirley Temple in her teens. lol I have several movies of her as a little girl and now I have one with her as a young woman.
Positive	Trilogey: Great action movie with a plot. This completes the series of John Wayne and John Ford westerns about the U.S. Calvery. Great history lesson.
Positive	Western DVD: John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!I'm not a big Henry Fonda fan, but good because of JW & other cast members.
Positive	One of the best: Fort Apache is another wonderful example of Fords amazing directing ability! It's a pity that he is still not around to make more of these classic epics.John Wayne does a spectacular job playing Kirby York. A brilliant if somewhat bitter character, who has spent a major portion of his life fighting Indians and is therefore much more aware of the danger of fighting them as if they were civilized soldiers who obey the tactics of war.Henry Ford, as usual does an incredible acting job, as the ignorant Colonel Owen Thursday, who's pride gets him into much more trouble then it's worthI can't say that I actually ever rooted for the Indians (who did a wonderful job of appearing uncivilized) which I suppose is how it's supposed to be :-) And I was highly disappointed that Owen never made it back. Even if he WAS a disagreeable person.Fort Apache is a must see! A GREAT video!
Negative	Fort Apache in Blu-Ray: I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this movie. This disk was made in Mexico. Itdoes not have the original picture ration. It is only 1:49 I owned this movie on DVD beforeI purchased it in blu-ray. The DVD has retained the original movie display. I will probablytry to find someone who doesn't mind but I won't watch it.
Positive	Western DVD: This is a good western and really well played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It carries you through a tough time in the relations of our expanding nation and the Indian nations.Chas E. Moser
Negative	fort apache: The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
Positive	A wonderful movie: This was the greatest movie! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!
Positive	another oldie but goodie: First I love John Wayne movies. I remember seeing this one when I was younger and wanted it. I really like the movies where you knew the Stars (not just actors/actresses who are here today for a couple movies and who knows them after that). I also love the movies of the 40s-early 60's as they told stories that you could also use your imagination on. That is not telling/showing me every detail that belongs in the bathroom and bedroom using vulgar language as well.
Positive	fort apache: John Wayne movies are the best.And with John Ford directing it's even more of a blockbuster.And Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple are great too.
Positive	"Needed Tightening in the Screenplay: While I like ""Fort Apache,"" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The screenplay to ""Fort Apache"" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, ""Fort Apache"" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like ""Fort Apache"" enough to add it to my collection, as I have ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy."
Positive	"One of the best: One of my favorite movies! Impressively sharp in blu-ray. Possibly the best of John Fords' ""cavalry trilogy"", the real star is Henry Fonda with John Wayne in a more supporting role. Doesnt appear that the other two movies in the trilogy are yet available in blu-ray, but am looking for them."
Positive	"Here Comes the Cavalry!: This movie is one part of the ""Cavalry Trilogy"" directed by John Ford. Ya gotta collect all three to get the best of the west from the U.S. Army's perspective. Hey, it's got John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Shirley Temple (all grown up), and introduces handsome John Agar (Shirley Temple's future real-life husband). It's a great movie. If you have not seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen it before, you know what I mean."
Positive	"FORT APACHE.: ""FORT APACHE"" JOHN WAYNE/JOHN FORD,WHAT A TEAM!! COULDN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH THIS ""PAIRING"" ALL THREE JOHN FORD CAVALRY MOVIES WERE GOOD SOLID ENTERTAINMENT, THE FORD FAMILY WERE A JOY TO WATCH!! THE BLU-RAY BLACK AND WHITE PICTURE TRANSFER IS CRISP. AND THE MONO SOUND IS EXCELLENT, GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!! RECOMMENDED. WOULD LIKE TO SEE ""SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON"" AND ""RIO GRANDE"" ON BLU-RAY, IN FACT ALL' JOHN WAYNE MOVIES ON BLU-RAY, WHY NOT? HE WAS THE GREATEST!!!!!!"
Positive	A Monumental Movie: Just returned from a trip out west including Monument Valley so I had to order the cavalry trilogy. This film is filled with great characters supporting Fonda & Wayne. The scenery is amazing.This is a spoiler but the ending caught me totally by suprise.If you think you know how the Duke will react in a movie you are dead wrong.Enjoy Shirley Temple, Victor McClauglen, Harry Carey etc. I enjoyed the actor who was Wayne's translator for his parlay with Cochise. I'm pretty sure he was in From Russia with Love too.A must see for Western or Wayne or Ford fans.
Positive	McQ: Fort Apache is one of my husband's favorite movies, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. He has a very large collection of them on VHS and now he is doing the same thing on DVDs.We both love a mystery, and westerns. If there is a little romance in them to, that is a bonus. Fort Apache is a western and full of adventure and movement. And it also has romance. A very good movie.Lu
Positive	Fort Apache ( Blu-Ray): Great movie and so glad to see this released to (Blu-Ray). Keep anything of John Wayne's great movies released on (blu-ray) coming as soon as they Available..
Negative	"You gotta be kidding!: This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. I got into the second mission and thought, ""Is this it?"" From what I can tell, there is only 5 missions. I couldn't take anymore past the second mission.You can't scroll around like in SimCity, Restaurant Empire, etc. It just very one dimensional. If you are looking for a game that doesn't have all the bells and whistles, then this is the game for you."
Negative	"Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2: I was thinking ""SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something."" This game has no educational value. But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2. Good tutorials and an actual understanding of how businesses run. If you want a fun business game, there are plenty of other tycoon games that have to be better than this."
Negative	It's passable: Real Estate Tycoon is just OK. The premise is strong but the graphics and interface are clunky, the sound average, and the business functions are weak. It's a cheap game...you get what you pay for.
Negative	"Where did the tutorials go?: I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
Negative	ok game: Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a ok game. kinda hard to figure out.hardly any instruction manual comes with the game only to tell you how to install the game. The game is partly confusing Activision could come up with a better way to make the game more simple. I been a Fan of Trump's for awhile.The gameplay is ok once you figure out how to play.I really didnt like the game that much because it was too complicated and time crawled in the game it could of went faster.
Negative	Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set): 5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
Positive	Small but very nice!: I bought this for a little Valentine's day gift for my 2.5yo. He has good fine motor skills for his age, so he can handle the tiny size. He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for. I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice. A lot of fun in a tiny package, and definitely worth the 6 bucks!
Negative	Disappointingly tiny: I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. But this one is really too tiny. I couldn't tell from Amazon's picture just how small it was! There may have been an indication of the dimensions in the product description, but I missed it. Perhaps Amazon needs to be more clear about these things.
Positive	Lauren's 6th birthday: I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. She loves this set and I love the pictures she makes!
Positive	Very Tiny Stamp Set: I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again.
Positive	farm animal stamps: looks nice. i purchased this as a gift & it has not been used yet. so i can't really rate it.
Negative	Not so great.: DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
Positive	"Great Near Future Hard Science Fiction Anime: Fans of ""Hard"" Science Fiction tend to steer clear of Anime, due to the goofy giant robots and what not. If you are a fan of ""Hard"" Science Fiction, especially in a near-future setting, this series will really impress you.Also note, the interviews with NASA ""orbital debris specialists"" continues on volumes 2 and 3 (I haven't purchased volume 4 yet, so I can't comment)."
Positive	Great fit: I loved they way they fit and perform. I am an avid outdoors man. They handle the snow, ,mud and tree branches great. Would recommend this product to anyone with pets or outdoors person.
Positive	good series: Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
Positive	Good DVD, but... No subtitles!: I'm a Brazilian train fan and I bought this DVD because Amazon said it was closed captioned... but not. No english subtitles for my better understanding and international customers.Positives: Image quality (DVD), DVD structure, good value.Negatives: No subtitles and too much narration... sometimes unnecessary.Obs.: A blue-ray version would be nice... with subtitles, of course!
Positive	Great view of trains from behind the surface: This is a great DVD that shows how trains run, all the people it takes to make things happen, etc. Yes, the host is a little overly enthusiastic/in your face, but this series is very informative/educational. I especially liked the comparison of today's railroad operations with how the railroad routes were constructed. For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV. Each episode is about 45 minutes (8 episodes in all) so you can plug this DVD in and watch something good while you're waiting for your next favorite show to come on. Enjoy!
Negative	EXTREMEly obnoxious: The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it.
Negative	Black?: The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. It's not much fun and the picture isn't as good as some. Not an enjoyable experience at all - and we love puzzles!
Positive	"Preaching as Storytelling-Par Excellence: Dr. Napier was my primary Old Testament professor and mentor at Yale Divinity School and ""Come Sweet Death"" comprised some of his imaginative chapel sermons in which he marvelously moves from the Biblical text into our cultural/social arena, applying the truths of Genesis to us. One must have some awareness of the Genesis text and scholarship of Gerhard von Rad and his American disciples, of whom Davie Napier is one; but Napier goes beyond von Rad in his interpretive skills and possesses unique insights. I use it as a resource text in my university/theological seminary courses. A must for the Biblical interpreter in a time when our sermons and commentaries are so flat and unexciting."
Negative	"false advertisement: I ordered a black titanium barbell. Once i recieved it, not even a day later black paint was chipping off my ""titanium ring."" Obviously the ring wasn't titanium, but painted steel, manipulatinf titanium."
Positive	My parrot loves this product.: This is the only food my 20 year old parrot will eat and it's getting harder and harder to find in my area. So glad to find it at Amazon. We're back in business!
Negative	Every paint was dried up: I purchased this a month ago for my daughter for Christmas. She just opened them to decorate the shoes this morning and every single paint except the light blue is completely dried up inside of the tube. She is disappointed and I am annoyed.
Negative	smells bad: Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. would not recommend
Negative	Disappointed.: I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already.
Positive	Fair Meets Sun: I'm practically an albino so I've had no luck with this type of product until now. The coloring is gradual and looks like a light base golden brown and has a nice scent. Good as it gets.
Negative	Oompa Loompa: I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult.
Positive	Fake Bake Tan: Being fair skinned, this is the perfect product to give my skin a little color without the damaging UV rays! Love it!!
Positive	Clear, Concise Overview of Essential Grammar Points: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People.
Positive	Excellent! Made college freshman English less frustrating: I use it and recommend it to many of my fellow students that are wading their way through college. Especially great for any international folk...the English language is a crazy beast.
Positive	Real dazzler: Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. I have always been a rock fan except for Albert Lee. His music is so well done and just plain pleasant to listen to that it draws me right in. His guitar skills are as good as anyone in the buisness. His guitar is always there but never overpowering. This CD contains material I originally bought on record more years ago than I'd care to admit. It still sounds as fresh and clean as it did all those years ago. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an ear for dazzling guitar work with a country flavor. His choice of material os first rate and the recording quality of the CD is also first rate. Buy this thing and you'll like it.
Positive	An Outstanding Read: An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book.
Positive	"reviews from ""Gramophone"" and ""American Record Guide"": &#65279;1. Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song."""
Positive	"Straight to the point: ""Seduce Me"" is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. ""Seduce Me"" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."
Negative	Disappointed: I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested. Believe it or not, some women have higher sex drives than their man. If you're a man needing some help with your partner, this is a good read. For a woman needing help with her man -- keep looking -- this book is not for you.
Positive	"Seduction Scenes - A Definite Turn On: When I started reading the Seduction Scenes chapter I felt that sexual tingle of excitement...just by reading it I was turned on! I thought that part of me was dead. After being married for almost 17 years with two active boys, I find it difficult to take the time to really enjoy sex like we used to do. Lately, it has been nothing but ""quickies"" so that I can sleep! Both my husband and I are looking forward to experimenting more with the Seduction Scene Strategies and Role Playing. I was telling my girlfriend about the book and she can't wait to read it!"
Negative	Not Much New Here: I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources. And frankly, I think there's just nothing new here.
Positive	Bunyan's Allegory: This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.
Negative	Poor Quality: The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.
Negative	Bad ink?: Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description.
Positive	The book of my life: I have read this book once already and I am reading it agian right now. It is the most inspiring and motivating book that I have ever read. It seems that every time that I am loosing the sight of my spiritual path this book seems to pop up. I love it and recommend to every one, no matter if they are a spiritual person or not.
Positive	A Story For Everybody: This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all.
Positive	Very nice quality.: I have not read the book as of yet, but just wanted to let people know how substantial this book really is. It is about the size and weight of a large dictionary. While not the best for portability, it is definitely a keepsake or collector type of book. It even has it's own ribbon style bookmark built in. Can't wait to read it.
Negative	Dumb: basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind.
Negative	"Puritanism at its best.: This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
Positive	a must-get for the battle of geonosis!: My son just got interested in collecting star wars action figures. He found this figure new in the case at a CD store in Greenville, SC. He has really enjoyed using this figure to recreate the battle of geonosis from Attack of the clones. It is also good for Dooku's final battle against Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. The only problem is the the paint on his lightsaber handle wears off easily. But it is a very good toy and an excellant addition to any star wars or action figure collection.
Positive	This is a good product: A good product, but costs a bit too much. I needed this and couldn't find it in any of the stores around where I live.
Positive	Great game for toddlers: This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
Positive	My sick dog needed a supplement- these work !: My miniature schnauzer (11.75 years old) has congestive heart failure, and won't eat any of the prescription dog foods. So, she gets unsalted people food (ground meats, rice, oatmeal, and various baby food fruits and veggies). I wanted to be sure she got enough of the vitamins and minerals that I can't really figure out, so got these. She won't eat them (but she won't eat anything 'dog' except Charlee Bear treats), but when I crush them and put them in applesauce, she doesn't spit them out. That's a win around here these days... :/
Positive	Good quality: Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn't like them too much. He ate them, but not enthusiastically.
Negative	Great collection - horrible quality: As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here.
Positive	"Still great after all these years!: I played this album so much in high school I wore the ink off the cassette tape! I probably hadn't heard it for 15 years, but when I popped in the CD I was singing along word for word again right away. Not that it's earth shakingly original, but this album is so much fun to listen to, and that's what's really more important. Tight, funky musicianship, a great party album and excellent remastering. ""Lasershow"" hasn't aged well, but everything else - the classic title track, ""Free Yourself,"" ""I Spy For The FBI"" and my personal favorite ""Piece Of Your Love"" - still gets you dancing. Glad to finally have a copy of ""Stepping Stone"" again, and the other B sides - especially ""Whiplash"" and ""Shine On"" - are great too.If you're reading this review, you know this is a lost '80s classic. Don't wait any longer - get it back in your collection!"
Negative	This Is A Regretable Mistake: The persons responsible for the concept and production of this recording should not be let loose in a recording studio again. That Christy Baron should acquiese to such drivel is beyond comprehension. That Chesky Records would allow it to be released should be a felony.C'mon. Electronics, sampling, throat singing? Were any gimmicks spared on this production?
Negative	Won't fit a 2000 gsxr600!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 has 3 bolts on the motor side, the pipe for 2001-2003 has 4 bolts, the holes don't line up. If you buy this pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 it WON'T FIT!!!!!!!
Positive	"Last Of The Mohicans: This entire CD is on the one. Of course ""Atomic Dog"" is the main cut, however ""Man's Best Friend"" is also a funky type of ""Knee Deep"" groove. ""Loopzilla"" is also a good song to dance to. The title cut ""Computer Games"" is as crazy as the artist. LOL. However, this album has a Funkadelic overtone. With musicians like Bootsy, Bernie, Mike, Junie, Eddie Hazel, Garry Shider and ect ect. it's worth buying. I think this is the best George Clinton album of all time. It's a R&B; Clssid and for the life of me I don't understand why it did not make the national top 40. Even the title cut went to 80 something on the charts. Go figure. George did get a award for the best video of that year.Go for ur funk"
Positive	"Believe in Atomic Dog: Clinton's contributions to popular music are practically limitless; perhaps most importantly, he kept waving his freak flag high long after most musicians caved in to their labels' demand for conformity. Computer Games showcases his talent for squeezing archetypal beats and riffs out of his ever-changing cadre of musicians. Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour. Try to keep from playing ""Where did I hear that sampled?"" and just let the funk wash you up and away to Clinton's psychedelic, sexed-up Disneyland. Every track's a winner."
Positive	"Loopzillacious!: ""Atomic Dog"" is so cold that after all these years party people still hurry to the dance floor on it--I've even seen't kcowboys line dancin' and doin' the Cotton-Eyed Joe on it. I guess evvy stray dawg will have his day and evvy computer playa will have a game. Thanx, Dr. Clinton, for programming this p-funky entropy."
Negative	Boring - Not a Good Version: I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. However, this one is my least favorite. The actress who plays Emma rather grated on my nerves and I did not enjoy her performance at all. I would not recommend this one.
Positive	Engaging Period Piece: This Austen adaptation is a joy and a gem in spite of its low production values. Thickly British.
Positive	delightfull miniseries with low production values: this miniseries is about a young matchmaker in regancy england who gets in involved everyones business. the performance are good but the production values are horbil and the costumes are very plain. but it is pretty good and is very faitfull to jane austens classic book.
Negative	Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!: Anyone who knows the book knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she's between 40 to 45 years old?Isn't this actress in this 70's BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20's?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.
Negative	Bleh!: Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it.
Positive	You will be rewarded if you stick with it: The production values of this early 1970's BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself. The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking. Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation. Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing. The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening. In fact I would have given this five stars if the first episode was as good as the rest. Well worth spending the money to enjoy this classic adaptation of Emma.
Negative	Worst Emma ever: Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth.
Negative	Emma as a deer in headlights!: While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh! It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version.
Positive	"Great reading and excellent story!: ""Haunted Summer"" is a great book for young teens and adults, too! It is a story of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized. I was very surprised by the circumstances, but can understand why Marilla had a choice to make. Read to see why the story is so fascinating. You will learn a lesson about yourself in the process, too."
Positive	Easy and fast to use: Great stuff and it works fast and easy. Not meant to refinish your kitchen, this is for Furniture only. Wear gloves and use outside or in a well ventilated area.
Negative	Not as easy to use as stated: Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. I am very disappointed and will need to use something to bring the table to life again!
Negative	thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high: I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!
Negative	Never again: I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. I bought everything that was recommended to use, the steel wool pads and the chemical gloves. This product ate through all the gloves we used, it disolved one of my friends acrylic fingernails, it felt like it was ice-burning our skin, made us all light-headed in a ventilated room and it barely did any improvements to my cabinets. I am concerned about us all absorbing this into our skin and any effect that may cause. I am returning all of the cans and I am VERY disappointed in this product.
Negative	"""O Brother"" Fans Beware!: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
Positive	Incisive and indicting: A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Guaranteed discussion starter.
Negative	Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography: Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy.
Negative	"lame photos and dreary topic: This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
Positive	Eerily amazing: When I first saw this book in my photo class, I thought the images were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn't read the text with all the pictures. When I bought it for myself, and got to read everything, it gave me even more of a respect for this work. Her snips of these girls lives rattle and amaze you at the same time. I love this book so much, and I think every girl/woman should look at it.
Positive	The product is good but the price isn't!: The product itself is very good. I bought it very frequently from amazon.com since my baby was born.But recently amazon.com raised the price from $7.49 to $10.49 which is much higher than any other grocery stores. Like in Target, the price is only $9.44!If amazon.com still maintains this highest price for this product, the customers like me will go to other stores for sure!
Positive	Cool!: When Claudia baby sits for the Rodowsky family, She and Shea become friends. they are both not good at spelling. they help each other in spelling. Nut stacey almost ruins Claudia and Stacey's friendship.
Positive	ANOTHER GREAT CD: 4 STARS BECAUSE it sounded fine but not as great as other string quartets.I like this because the string quartet 2 uses 2 cellos.,1 violin,1 viola which was interesting.You can hear the cello more than in the other string quartets with 2 violins.This also another rare CD at a simple price.
Negative	Lack of Sensitivity: Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so.
Positive	"Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family: If you enjoy movies that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here's the one you've been looking for.Brando was considered a legend, and this movie is proof; ""acting"" is too small a word to describe the performance he gave here.Pain. Confusion. Lust. Grasping at redemption as it slithers through your fingers--it's all right here, folks.This movie is a carousel of torment. There's an anonymous person riding next to you, and both of you have to laugh at it all, just to keep from crying."
Positive	"I can't believe it's not butter!: It's hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives ""the performance of a lifetime"", which in his case, after seeing ""Superman"", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre Laúd is execrable and Mássimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival. All in all, much ado about... butter!"
Negative	"Last Tango In Paris: The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. The Hayes Commission version is edited for content to the point the film loses it's provocative edge, with out which is disjointed (pun intended) and boring. I've looked elsewhere for the original release version which at the time was X rated, but now all I see is the ""R"" rating which means all the good scenes are cut out!But I'll Keep looking. It's a real hot classic in it's original formRapscallion"
Negative	"Overrated: Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."
Positive	Great Movie: This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work.
Negative	Last Tango in Paris: Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
Negative	Don't buy it!: I never saw the movie when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. It is the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I am a movie buff. The acting and storyline is horrible. In the nudity shots she looks like she is wearing a black bear skin rug on her private parts. Don't waste your money on this one.
Negative	"Horrible, wretched, totally overrated: Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is ""art,"" skip this. It's stupid, sexist, pretentious, the dialogue is wretched, you don't CARE about any of the characters... and a lot of other things that other reviewers have already said."
Negative	Stupid movie: When this movie first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. The plot was silly and Brando's acting was awful.
Negative	Unbelievably Stupid: How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in movie history. Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time.
Positive	"Be A Dear And Pass The Butter Please!!!: In this movie we see Malon Brando as an ageing oversexed man who embarks on a liason with a young woman played by Maria Schieder. That is about the whole plot and storyline for this movie. In this film Mr. Brando finds a very inventive use for butter which does not involve making a sandwich. He is once said to have remarked that ""acting is a bum's life"" so if you want to see a bum at work I suggest you watch this movie. I give this film 5 stars because Maria Schnieder thankfully went into movie obscurity after making his film."
Negative	Last Tango In Paris: I though the film was terrible. Brando mumbled in French and the plot was unrealistic. I purchased the film to see how sexualism has changed over the years, since this was touted to be the first of expicit sexual scenes.
Negative	They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY: There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
Negative	"BS Detector Hits ""11"": Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
Positive	Highly intellectal and emotional multi-plotted story.: What can one say about such a powerful story? Is it about love? Is it about irony? Is it about lust? Is it about loss? What is it all about? That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man. It's a masterpiece!
Negative	trash masquerading as art: Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess.
Positive	Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.
Positive	worth seeing: While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective.
Negative	A movie that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. It can be fast-forwarded to the end without anything being missed. Alas, poor Brando, we knew him well.
Negative	One long WTF? moment.: We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal.
Positive	Classic Marlon Brando Movie.....: I read the mixed reviews for this movie, so I had to comment. This movie is classic. The storyline may offend some people, but come on. Life is rocky, and believe me, going over the rocks with Marlon Brando would be a pleasure. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1972, and I still enjoy it today in 2010. Tango anyone??
Negative	"Unappealing and unnecessarily perverted: I went into this film thinking that I would see an unorthodox film involving sex. I've seen many films that could fit this description such as ""Happiness"" by Todd Solondz and ""Romance"" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating."
Negative	"nothing of value: It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered ""art"" and ""decent"". To me, it was just a monumental waste of time, like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci's work."
Negative	Can't be that great.: I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it.
Negative	Couldn't wait for it to be over!: I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back.
Negative	This is a great film?: Let me get this straight. The story starts with a man and a woman, strangers looking at vacant apartment. They walk around a bit, say a few words, then he grabs her and they go to it. Nothing is given to justify this, no romance, no chemistry, no flirting, not even lustful looks. It is as if two people just ran into each other on the street and went straight at it. This is great film making? On what planet?
Negative	Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time: Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie.
Negative	A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY: This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.
Positive	"Unforgettable: Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
Negative	Twisted and boring: The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters. Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I didn't like but couldn't leave. Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film.
Negative	Extremely disappointing: This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time.
Positive	3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago.
Negative	Materpiece that needs an overhall: faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
Negative	Depressing, Despicable and Down-right Disgusting: Marlon Brando was one of the most overrated actors of all time. Anyone who knows about his personal life and still thinks he was a respectable person should have their head examined. The fact that he was comfortable with this awful role says enough about the kind of man he was. Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough. The story and soundtrack couldn't even come close to saving this trash either.
Negative	"Quite possibly the worst movie in cinematic history: Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. On the DVD case, a reviewer squeals: ""The most erotically powerful movie ever made!"" Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like ""vacant"", ""nihilistic"", ""empty"", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."
Negative	what's the big deal?: This has to be the most overrated movie ever made. Even by 1970's standards, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Marlon Brando is just his usual brooding self. The girl is extremely beautiful, but even if she was naked through the entire movie, I cannot understand why anyone considers this a cinema masterpiece.
Positive	Great bindings, good commentaries: We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; Coriolanus
Negative	Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes: I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle.
Positive	Great composition: Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but reading the real, written work is another world. It is a different way to think of the story you know. I bought this compilation to read all of Shakespeare's works and it is truly great. One thing I'd advise is that you know how to read scripts. This book is written as Shakespeare wrote his plays. Though, every work is prefaced with the characters names and role they play, it can still be a bit difficult to get through because of the way it's written.Jul. Then, window let day in and let life out.Rom.Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.[descendsJul.Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!It can become a bit much.I gave it four stars because it has such small font: around 8 or 9 px font you'd find on MS word.
Positive	An heirloom for every American: As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls. Beautifully assembled, this keepsake will instill pride in its citizenry. Making selections from myriad possibilities must have been a dire undertaking, but those represented indicate a fair cross-section of time and geography. An excellent tribute to a worthy source!
Negative	Not a good value for the price: Given the price of this book, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Too little information for a hardcover book that supposed to be a guide for manufacturers on how to implement TOC.
Positive	"Funk Music and Sufism: The music of Mercan Dede, or with his other name DJ Alan Arkin, is taking us to a travel in the land of Sufism. I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song ""Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi"", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. ""Walking on the Red Sea"", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do."
Positive	Exciting Action and Adventure: I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. It's been years since I read a historical novel that was so well written. But do yourself a favor, read Into the Wilderness first. I found myself wondering so much about references to things that happened in the first book that I just had to search for it to read. And I wasn't disappointed. But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels. It's like Elizabeth can never catch a break. I am now eagerly awaiting the paperback printing of Lake in The Clouds. I plan to pass these books on as a set, to anyone I know who is into historical novels.
Positive	Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!: This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters. (A deeper view) I kept turning the pages wanting more, and was rewarded. When all is said and done with this series, this book in paticular will have a special place with me. It's a delight!
Negative	Into the Wilderness It's NOT: I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition.
Positive	Great series: It can be a little slow at times but I have enjoyed this series and fallen in love with many of the characters. I would recommend.
Positive	Captiating!: Cannot put it down, just like the rest of the series. Moments of emotion, suspense, happiness and sadness. The story just gets better and better.
Positive	On a trip: The 2nd book, was very good. I preferred the story line in the wilderness of NY, but it was a swashbucklingly good story in itself. I like the characters that where brought in. Just wish kindle made it clearer that these books are part of a series, and which one comes after the other.
Positive	"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I had read Donati's series of six Wilderness books and really liked them so I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she had read the first one and liked it. They are long books but never boring. I thought the book would be a larger size, as the soft cover ""Into the Wilderness"" had a bigger cover with a little larger print but the book came quickly, was reasonably priced, and my daughter is happy to receive it. Donati is a really good writer. I only discovered her this year. - Fran"
Positive	DDS...a roller coaster ride!: This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!
Positive	"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I found ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland. It continued with the lifes of the Bonner family and close friends and brought back some characters from the past that added more intrigue. I read through it quickly because I couldn't put it down. Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean."
Positive	Lovely Romance: The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. I loved following the budding romance.
Negative	Not Worth My Time: I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me.
Positive	A Strong 4.5 Stars: This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book.
Negative	Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters.
Negative	"I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.: I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"
Negative	"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I ""skimmed"" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper."
Negative	Yawn on Distant Shore.....: I found this sequel to be a big disappointment and pales in comparison to Donati's first book. This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was.
Negative	The story falls over: The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place.
Negative	Yawn.: I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!
Negative	Disappointed: Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
Negative	Not as good as her other books: I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better.
Positive	Much Better than the first: This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!
Negative	Good, but I expected more: After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license.
Positive	"An excellent read!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate ""fluff"", then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading."
Negative	"Very disappointing!!!: I was so thrilled with vol. 1 ""Into the Wilderness"" that I ordered the second volume from the library before investing money into a hardcover version. I'm glad I didn't buy one as it was the most disappointing book since I read Kate Morton.""Into the Wilderness"" was so promising and I really wonder how the sequel can be so shallow?This whole journey from Montréal, Canada, to Dumfries, Scotland, used up close to 300 pages in the book and when Nathaniel and Elizabeth are finally in Scotland, things don't get any more interesting.What a boring read!Zero stars was not possible, so I have to give it 1 star :(.I hope ""Lake in the Clouds"" will be better, but if it's only about Hannah, I doubt I will read it.I was hoping to read more about Nathaniel and Elizabeth."
Positive	"review: I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."
Positive	A devoted reader!!: When I had read Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. Sara Donati makes the characters in the book seem so real. I felt like I was part of the book. I felt their pain, joy, and worry with them along the way. I can't wait till the next book comes out so I can meet up with my friends again, and go along the new journey! This is the best book anyone could ever read!!!
Negative	dawn on a distant shore: Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work.
Negative	A boring disappointment!: Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money.
Negative	"Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. I had read ""Into the Wilderness"" and loved it for the writing and characterzations. It was done so well. This book hardly seemed to have been written by the same author. It was rushed, badly written and I could not get into it. Such a shame from someone who had been my new favorite author."
Negative	BORING!: Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon.
Positive	Nice value tent: Easy set up overall. Wish the bottom was lined with tarp instead of nylon.Good roomy ceiling. Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.
Positive	"Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
Positive	perfect campground tent: You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get.
Positive	Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
Negative	Beware - Product is not as pictured: While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch.
Positive	In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart.
Positive	If only real women were like this . . .: _The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this. But, one can always hope that there are still a few out there.
Negative	over-rated!: poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
Negative	Hard to feel anything for the characters: This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience.
Positive	"Amazing: I love horror/thriller movies but rarely ever get frightened from them. This movie was great. I was genuinely scared. I think that this movie has the best ""monsters"" in a long time. Definitely getting it for my dvd collection."
Positive	Awesome: This is probably the most effective horror movie I have ever seen. The all female cast does a phenomenal job of keeping the audiences attention (and no there is no nudity). Shows what a talented director and cast can do with little money and a good story. Has more scares and is more entertaining than the majority of horror that is released in theatres.
Positive	TRULY SCARY - Blu-ray Perfection!: I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!
Negative	A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out.
Negative	Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel?: If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did.
Negative	boring. boring. and....yes boring.: I don't know what type of movies these people watch but this movie was NOT scary, it had NO suspense, and was just plain boring. I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring.
Negative	"Kind of lame, as most horror movies are: I'm not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch ""The Descent"" with her, and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy ""The Descent"" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."
Negative	"Boring movie with good Blu-ray features: THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in ""behind the scenes"" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes. I bought it for ten bucks at Wal-mart and I guess it was worth that for the cool features on the Blu-ray but I sure feel ugly and bored after watching it all."
Negative	It could have been really good...but: Some things were good, but more were bad, here's a run down of the positive and the negative:(+)side:1.the setting of an underground cave2.couple moments that make you jump3.great concept(-)side:1.story2.cast3.troll creatures4.tried to take itself too seriously
Negative	"ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!: Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
Negative	"The Descent?: Almost a full hour into this movie before you see what the movie is even supposed to be about. It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of ""horror"" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like ""Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles"". If your going to advertise a movie as ""scary"" and ""horror"" than MAKE IT LIKE ONE. This is just a chick flick with some ""BOO!s"" tossed in towards the end, stay away from this failed flick."
Positive	"Chicks with Accents in America!: This movie is a little dated. I am sure it scared the every loving be-jesus out of folks when it came out. That said, its still scary! It will keep your interest thats for sure. Hey- we are talking 6 foxy chicks going into a cave to crawl around. What guys interest does that not hold? Chicks will enjoy the female choas of the group. There are a couple of scenes that will unsettle even the most stone faced horror show movie goer. Oh- the funny thing about this movie is that all the chicks have British accents. Not sure how this happens, but it adds to the charm of these chicks crawling around the cave. ""Is anyone injured?"", vs (American)""Are you OK?"". Its worth buying, and seeing a couple a times."
Positive	3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Without question the best horror film to come out in the last decade (not that it's had much competition), The Descent takes a little time to develop an interesting (and all female) group of friends before plunging them into a situation that would be terrifying enough even if there weren't creatures to worry about; if you like horror and haven't seen this film then you should be ashamed.Note: Please watch the unrated version/Director's cut for a much better ending
Positive	A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this. Excellent horror adventure.
Negative	"Another one bites the dust..: Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
Negative	Bad!: The first DVD I received had no disc! The second one I received was packaged fine but halfway through the movie it had static, skipped, etc. Very poor quality.
Negative	"THIS SUCKS: THIS IS THE STUPIDIEST MOVIE EVER MADE. AND THOSE WHO SAY IT IS A GREAT MOVIE SHOULD HAVE THEIR HEADS EXAMINE. A GANG OF BORED WOMEN WITH NOTHING TO DO WIT THEIR LIVES GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO BE EATEN BY SOME UNDERGROUND ALBINO, BLIND CREATURES THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM.ONE, FOR WONEN WITH EDUCATION ( DOCTORS, LAWYERS,ETC.) THEIR VOCABULARY IS VERY LINITED TO FOUR LETTER WORDS. SECOND, CLICHE ALL OVER THE PLACE, ONE OF THEM IS THE ""'DUH' I'M FOR EVERYTHING"" CHARACTER, ANOTHER ONE IS THE ""SENSITIVE' I LOST MY HUSBAND"" PERSON, ANOTHER IS THE "" I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING"" PERSON, AND THE REST WISHY-WASHY. HALF WITTED GROUO THAT DO NOT QUESTION.THE END IS PREDICTABLE ""!LISTEN PEOPLE! NO-ONE IS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN. DUH.....IT STOLE STORY-LINES FROM GOOD HORROR MOVIES LIKEW ALIEN FOR INSTANCEIF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS TO THIS MOVIE; BELIEVE, I WOULD"
Negative	DUMB!: This movie is a bunch of nonsense. A group of girls (rolls eyes) explores a cave in the U.S.A. (rolls eyes again) with aliens living in it (rolls eyes a third time). DUMB. I can not believe all the good reviews I have read. They must all be from the production staff.
Negative	horror for ten year olds: Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about.
Negative	LOUSY: This movie was about an inch of me gonging it. It was like I was in the cave watching it. I plan to sell it to Blockbuster because it is not worthy to be in my collection.The best part was the end.
Negative	Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and: Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and....
Negative	FAIR: THE MOVIE FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. I KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOU TO KNOW THE CHARCTERS IN THE BEGINNING. THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DID KNOW ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK THE CHARCTERS WERE STRONG ENOUGH. MAYBE THEY NEEDED STRONGER ACTRESSES LIKE SIGOURNY WEAVER, LINDA HAMILTON EVEN ANGELA BASSET. BUT THE MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS. IT'S GOOD TO WATCH, AND IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON WHEN YOU HAVE MOVIE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS. :-)
Negative	descent into stupidity: I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
Negative	SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!: I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!
Negative	Disappointing hollywood formula ending: Buyer beware. This is a version with a feel good hollywood formula ending. It is not the original, it was redone to give the US viewers a somewhat happy and typical USA horror ending / resolution, (pretty symbolic of our countries state I would say). Get the European version. I bought this thing w/o realizing they redid it, now I am buying the original---
Negative	Don't waste your time...: What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?
Positive	"I never get scared, BUT!!!: I thought that The Ring was funny when that girl came out of the TV. I still get a kick out of how ""not scary"" that was. The Grudge made me cackle with joy when the hairy ghost girl emerged, how funny! Nothing seem to scare me in theatre anymore, except for this movie. I didnt really know what it was about when I saw it, and I atually got goose bumps. It combines good acting with many types of horror. The horror of being trapped in a cave system and then finding out you are not alone in there! There are times when you feel your heart pace quicken because of the tight situations. Basically, just watch it and dont watch it alone! Make sure its dark and enjoy!"
Positive	good movie: I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies.
Positive	good movie: It is worth to watch, good story, scaring but also attractive, should it is very good for friends' gathering, all ppl watch together
Positive	good: Its a great movie for jumps and scares and the story is not that bad. I have a high end system and the audio is pretty awesome as it helps convey the Scary elements. The picture is good on my HD TV but not the best I've seen. Its a great movie to pop on a rainy night especially enjoyed on a good surround sound system!
Positive	Terrorific Extreme Adventuring: When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure.
Positive	good all the way thru: Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
Positive	Better than expected.: Not bad! Worth the watch! The monsters or whatever were a little weird but oh well, still some scary stuff.
Positive	I'm not going spelunking!: If ever a movie made me want to stay out of dark caves this one is it. Love the creepy dark surprises.
Positive	A good flick: This is a good modern take on a wonderful H.P. Lovecraft story. The claustrophobic element is great, the cinematography is good and the story keeps you entertained.
Positive	Stay Far Away from Caves: Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
Negative	Not bad for a budget movie: I thought they did a good job with makeup in the movie but the script and the way it was directed was not typical for a movie of this type. Made it feel more budget.
Positive	What a movie....: This movie was very very good, but confusing at the end. It is a great scare, most will enjoy the movie. Be ready for a fright night! Enjoy!
Negative	Waste of Time: READ THE BOOK!!! This is just a horribly pieced together slasher film. The book is a really good read, don't see this unless you're trying to scare your eight ear old sibling.
Positive	"The Descent: This is quite simply one of the best horror movies ever made. And this comes from a person who watches almost nothing but horror every day. Never has a movie been so bleak since ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". Neil Marshall first made his mark on ""Dog Soldiers"", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing. This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite, ever made."
Positive	"The Descent.: A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."
Positive	The Descent: This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much.
Positive	"WOW Great movie!!: I could just say ""WOW"" and leave it at that! If you like scary movies, movies with lots of action, and movies that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD......well, then buy this movie!! It has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies!!"
Negative	Descent Review: I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also.
Negative	No turkey just a STINKER: Wow- i remember renting this when it first came out, and probably would have both excited and scared me if i was 12, ok maybe 13 or even 14. Beyond predictable, and the scary stuff was just smoke and mirrors to me. Really a waste of time as I have seen better B plots. Filmography was decent but that was about it
Negative	BORED AT ALL...: I SAW THE MOVIE BUT IT'S BORED AT ALL. ALSO IT'S NOT ENJOYMENT. THE CREATURE WAS STRANGE AND DISGUSTING. I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD-LOOKINGBUT IT WAS NOT. ANYWAY THIS MOVIE WAS A FAILURE.
Negative	disappointing: I didn't find the Descent to be a very interesting film. It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere.
Negative	"one star and one jump: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
Negative	One of the worse horror films ever made.: Just finished watching this movie and the best thing about it is it finally ended.Slow, boring, and extremely gory with uninteresting characters tied to a script filled with cliches. That about does it except if you're having trouble sleeping do watch it since it's a wonderful cure for insomnia.
Negative	Trash...utter trash: After getting about five minutes into this movie, I was wondering why I should care. I was wondering the same thing at fifteen minutes, half an hour, an hour, and all the way through the end.Frankly, I was bored, I thought the suspense was completely transparent, the characters unbelievable, and the acting mediocre at best.Complete waste of time. Watch paint dry instead. You'll thank yourself.
Negative	HORRIBLE. PLAIN HORRIBLE....: I have nothing good to say about this movie as it made no sense at all execpt that the female's British accents were cool.
Negative	"Well, that was terrible...: I'm disapointed that I'm never getting back the 99 minutes of my life I wasted on watching ""The Descent."" It's just as stupid as the Project Greenlight movie, ""Feast"" (horror/sci fi). This one definitly goes on the list of movies I wish I DIDN'T watch. VERY predictable...tried working off of sheer gore...and when that didn't work...well...I was kind of cheering for them all to die. ;-)The best part about this movie:I didn't pay to rent it, my sister did! Hahahaha...P.S. PICK SOMETHING ELSE...ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS IS BETTER!"
Negative	Desucked: If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
Negative	Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut.
Positive	Pretty creepy: I had hopes for this one and it delivered. I liked how I was never sure what to expect, even though some elements were typical of suspenseful/horror movies. It was gory enough to make me cringe, and creative in that it isn't an unbeatable super-monster based tale. I like the ending, and would like to see the alternate, as well. Really good stuff!
Positive	"Intense: Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely ""The Descent 2,"" will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!"
Positive	"Take ""The Descent"" into a realm of pure terror!: If you are tired of those lame, ineffective horror movies that have been advertised to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you to death, take a look at ""The Descent"" for a fresh new look on this view.This movie WILL terrify you beyond all belief. You will find yourself just as scared as the victims in this movie. You will be clenching onto the nearest item in anticipation for what is going to happen next. Because, trust me, you really have no idea what will happen next.I found myself practically leaping out of my seat in terror. And, trust me everyone, that RARELY happens. I go through most movies with a whatever attitude and don't show any fear. I make it through movies like The Exorcist without breaking a sweat. However, this movie had me wondering what was going to happen and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire time.Once again, IF you want that horror film that will not let you down in the slightest bit, pick up ""The Descent"" today."
Positive	"a veritable masterpiece: neil marshal's The descent"" is a great movie.the outline is as follows.six girlfriends go caving only to find out they are not alone in the cave.what follows is a fast paced adrenaline fueled thrill ride that grabs you by the throat and won't let go.there are many scary moments in the film.there is a nice buildup of suspense before the creatures are revealed, and once they are, they are terrifying.the acting is good and there characters are well developed in the early stages of the film(before the caving scenes).you may be out of breath before this one ends.if you get scared easy, you may want to watch this movie with someone or you might not get through it,as it is intense.i liked the twist ending, which sets up nicely for a sequal.i saw the britsh version, in which the ending apparrently differs from the north american.i can't wait to check out the north american version to compare.you have to check out this movie. 5* out of 5"
Positive	Finally, a decent horror movie: This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. It's about time they made a horror movie with strong female leads that doesn't degrade them or use them as eye candy dangled in front of a sadistic killer.This movie had a lot of layers to its characters and the creatures were freaking scary!
Positive	Above grade: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded.
Negative	Dark and Confusing: I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two.
Negative	Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!
Positive	The difference between unrated and regular version: First of all let me say i really enjoyed this movie. Not like a regular slasher. Its very good. I actually seen it at the show. Now the main difference that no one has listed out of all these reviews is, just the ending. I didnt see any more gore than was at show. Something unrated doesnt always mean extra gore or sex. Anyway just the ending is different than one that was seen in US theatres. I wont spoil ending for you if you havent seen, but most know from youtube what its really suppose to be. Anyway pick this movie up and add it to your collection. Its a keeper!
Positive	Creepy Cave Trips Are Never a Good Idea: This movie is scary. This group of women thinks it is fun to go on annual adventure trips. I prefer a nice hotel on the beach, but creepy crawly caves sound better to them. You really get to know the characters and care about them and the things they have been through. It is their trip to the caves and what they go through there that will terrify you. If you are claustrophobic, you will definitely be freaked out by this movie. I love a good scary movie, which may be why I am an insomniac, and this movie is well written and acted and will give you the creeps. I highly recommend it. Power Path to Love
Positive	"Great Horror movie!: I love horror movies. Unfortunatly, it's hard for me to find any that actually scare me. ""The descent"", however, does a fantastic job. I popped it into my DVD player with the average expectations of a ""horror"" movie set in caves with girls as the protagonists. About halfway in though, when the ""monsters"" finally showed up, (with a very creepy introductory view from down a tunnel) I was pressed into my couch as far as I could go, arms around knees, and intently watching every moment of the movie.I have never squealed like a girl while watching a horror movie, but ""The Descent"" evoked several from me, and I was thankful to be watching it without witnesses!I highly recommend ""The Descent"" to anyone seeking a scary movie!"
Positive	Amazing.: 2006 has been packed with PG-13 horror films, lots of them. Then are the gore flicks (TCM the beginning), and other stuff. Finally, a good horror movie comes out in august: THE DESCENT, a British horror film with a good twist.STORY: One year after a car accedent, 6 women reunite in a cabin in the Appilachian mountains to Go on a caving expedition. When they arrive at the cave, the descent into the cave begins, and their exit is blocked. They keep praying and pushing, hoping for another exit, but a bunch of deadly creatures attack...THOUGHTS: THis is a cool movie. Good music, great s/fx, and great lighting, I thought it was cool that the only light was natural.SO see this film!
Positive	The Descent Blu-ray Review: I already have this movie on DVD, but like it so much that I ordered it on Blu-ray too. I am very impressed with the quality of the HD. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an original horror flick! I also continue to be impressed with Amazon's excellent service and quality products.
Positive	"Well cast, intense, and suprisingly unconventional: This movie could have easily been an inane, repititious, piece of garbage. Just cast one, or more, of US Weekly/STAR/TMZ's latest darlings. Let 'em stumble through the film with mediocre acting skills- but perfect hair and make up! The pay off? Why those opening weekend box office returns of course!Instead, ""The Descent"" takes the road less traveled, no pun intended. The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well. Altruistic and nurturing one minute, egomaniacal and totally aloof the next.The film exploits a common phobia; being trapped, enclosed places, etc., by showing us the most extreme and terrifying scenario. And it works! This movie is chillingly intense."
Negative	Blows!!!: As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money.
Negative	CAVE-DWELLING SLASHER FLICK: My expectations were very high when I bought this DVD. The first 45 minutes of the movie were a little slow, but seemed to be building up some momentum. The first 15 minutes of cave diving with the bush league spilunkers was OK!. After that, the flick just turned into another slasher movie in a cave. The darkness added little and the plastic vampires were a little too stupid to watch. Nothing more than a slashers flick! What a total disappointment.
Negative	"Horrible film.: This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""
Negative	BOOOOOORRRING!!!!: Until now, there was some debate aboutPlan 9 from Outer Spacebeing the worst movie ever made. Well, the debate is over...The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)wins that prize hands down! There's definitely something wrong with a movie when you find yourself rooting for the monsters more than the victims. And how come all the monsters look like mindless male brutes? Hmmm...Thank goodnes for the FAST FORWARD button, and even more thanks for the STOP button. Now, if I can just find the FORGET button!
Negative	overated and robbed: Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. Perhaps its me, I am retard! but I felt I was robbed of time. I found it lacked story, and the moral of the story was odd. ok, in the end, the main character dreamed it all--did she? The Journey to the Centre of the Earth had much more imagination and charm by the rope length!
Negative	This is a joke!!: I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Needless to say once I started watching it, I was bored for the first hour. Then these ridiculous looking monsters appear out of nowhere.ABSOLUTELY BORING, HARD TO SEE, and STUPID. WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie.
Negative	Don't Waste Your Time: I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time.
Negative	"It COULD have been a great movie . . ..: Okay. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere was suitably claustrophobic. The background music fit the feel of the movie. The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the ""heroine"". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . .."
Positive	A great follow up to Dog Soldiers: The Descent has everything you could want in a horror film. The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien. While I enjoyed Dog Soldiers quite a bit, The Descent is a film worthy of my horror DVD collection.
Positive	Dark and Claustrophobic Horror: The Descent is a horror movie that develops a plot that's original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. I had never seen these actresses, who here play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version).
Positive	Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!: Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book.
Positive	Very Entertaining Movie: I watched the China Doll movie DVD that I received from Amazon.com and thought it was very entertaining movie. The movie builds up the relationship between Capt. Brandon (Victor Mature) and Shu Jin (Li Li Hua) which leads to their marriage and having a little baby. It is sad at the end as both Shu Jin and Capt. Brandon are both killed, but it was nice to see the daughter 14 years later being met at Los Angeles Airport by Capt. Brandon's old crew. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies that end up being very heartwarming.
Positive	Wonderful Movie: I have not seen this movie since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon, I bought it straight away. On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy.
Positive	About China Doll: This is a movie that i've wanted for over 20 yrs. Amazon.com is my hero!!!! This movie made me cry when i watched it after i had seen it with my dad, who died in 1990. This is a movie that makes me feel closer to him.
Negative	Too Old: I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling.
Negative	Terrible! Beyound-use date: Lipstick that arrived is so old, it even smells worse then my granny's oldest lipstick which she takes out from the tube with a match!I had to throw it away....
Positive	Borror and Delong's Study of Insects: Great price...well over half off of the university's bookstore. Only black and white pictures and illustrations, but very thorough coverage of entomology.
Positive	REVIEW - Borror & DeLong: This is a keystone book that should be in every entomologist's library next to Chapman's The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano's The Science of Entomology.
Positive	Book purchase: Product was in excellent shape as indicated.I received the book quickly and would definitely do business with these people again.thanks
Negative	Only a music producer can like this.: Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation.
Negative	beware: The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant.
Negative	happy i only wasted money for 2 Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound: Music Experience in 3-Dimensional SoundThis cd shouldnt have been recordedMy fault i bougt this cdWas tempted of the dts recordingI could have readed other rewiewsThe experience listen to this is saddnes over own stupidityLoke1858
Negative	oh my goodness!: If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dollar must have dropped through the floor.
Positive	"The dummy ""FATS"" is hysterical!!!!: ALL I can really say about the movie is that the puppet steals the show. It really didn't matter how weak the story was because the puppet's comments made the show."
Negative	"Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
Negative	"More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony: Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
Positive	"Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Movie!: forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as ""Fats"", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor."
Positive	MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!: Though the movie was frightening enough, it wasn't what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. What I witnessed was the thing that STILL freaks me out when I think about it. The Magic commercial. All it was was Fats the dummy reciting a demonic poem. I can still say the poem to this day. I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again.
Positive	Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated: FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since. Still, it has left a lasting , unavoidable impression upon me. I have both dreaded and longed to see it again. Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible.
Positive	"Magic: If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. It is a bit ""off"" but it keeps you watching. A very different movie. Saw this years ago and remembered it. It never comes on cable. I think it is worth a look."
Positive	Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film.: I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing.
Positive	"A ventriloquists nightmare: Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist ""Corky"" and his dummy ""fats"" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in ""Magic"". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now."
Negative	great movie massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon.
Positive	"Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers: ""Magic"" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with ""The Bunker"" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles."
Negative	"The Only Dummy Is The Writer: ""Magic"" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book."
Positive	"""He's NO Dummy. . ."": Viewing ""Magic"" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to ""watch this actor."" I saw ""Magic"" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a ""squeeze box"" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role."
Positive	Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing.
Positive	"A truly great horror movie: I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."
Positive	Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it.
Positive	classic: i got this for my dad. it is super creepy and worth a watch, but don't watch it in the dark.
Positive	Psychological thriller!: This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
Positive	A little more money than what I expected to spend on in.: This is a good movie. My husband enjoyed it. I wasn't too impressed with the price of the movie since it was an older film.
Negative	"""The Silence of the Dummies"": This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! ""Fats"" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see ""Fats"", but during some of the more ""romantic "" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real ""vent"" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit ""outside"" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano"
Negative	Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself.
Negative	Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters.
Positive	"A revelation of life in small town America in early 1900s: Though a scholarly biography, the book reveals much more about life in a small mid-west America town at the turn of the century than many other biographies or novels. Well worth reading for an insight into ""news"" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon."
Positive	Great biography of a very interesting journalist: This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating read. The role of the small-town newspaper publisher carried much of the moral weight of towns like Lamar, Missouri, during the first half of the twentieth century before the era of instant news carried by radio and television changed everything. The author does a fine job of demonstrating the role in both politics and society that newspaper publishers played during this era. Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri. In addition, he was a character that continues to shape the nature of the small town where he published; his legacy newspaper still is in publication.
Negative	Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century.
Negative	Don't buy: The box looked used and it is obviously not new. I have tried to contact them by email and no response. Don't buy from them!
Positive	Beautiful Pen and Fast Delivery.: The pen was shipped promptly. This is the classic Montblanc pen that everyone raves about. It is Black in color with Golden Trim. It holds it's own and I am thankful to my parents to gift this to me as a Graduation Present. Someday I plan on buying more of these pens from Amazon.The vendors at Amazon are amazing. I have been a long time shopper at Amazon, mostly pens and electronics. However this pen was gifted to me by my mom and she has nothing but good things to say. I on my part love this pen.
