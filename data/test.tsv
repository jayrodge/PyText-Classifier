Positive	"Wonderful book: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the ""family"" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."
Positive	Super Scary and Fascinating: Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing.
Positive	Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil.: Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman.
Negative	kindle edition warning ...no pictures: what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this.
Positive	Helter Skelter: I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be.
Positive	Amazing.: I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book.
Negative	The plague that this book has caused.: Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone.
Negative	"Too bad the book is completely fiction...: The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious ""ideology"".He needed to give ""evil"" a face... and Manson was convenient.""Helter Skelter"" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."
Negative	"Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie: I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his ""Helter Skelter"" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."
Negative	"the classic pulp novel is still selling fast: Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."
Negative	Helter Smelter: Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?
Negative	Gratuitous slasher porn: In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago.
Negative	Helter Skelter: The DA's own fabrication: This story is not the true story of the murders, but the concoction of VB. The whole Helter Skelter theory was in his mind and in his mind only-he saw ahead to the book deal and movie. Of all the seat's in the court room, over 98% were taken by media. He played into their hands by making up this totally outrageous story (prompted by a liar Sadie and turn coat,get me outta my legal mess Danny DeCarlo). This is fiction. And by the way, Charlie wasn't even present at any of the murder scenes, nor did he order any murders, so why is he in prison? Because he received an unfair trial at the hands of VB. This book is NOT recommended.
Positive	"Blood Fest 1969: The chilling story as told by detective Bugliosi will scare and shock you to your utmost. There is an eerie sense all about you that keeps you wondering how such diabolocal people could exist in this world. In all its gorey details and brutally honest depiction of the Manson ""Family"" Bugliosi does not shield the reader from the horrrid acts committed. He is forthright in his personal fellings toward the murders and his perception of the Manson ""Family"" including their theology that ""Helter Skelter"", the final war between the balcks and the whites, is the most outrageous in all of history, which made everything in connection to the murders just as strange."
Positive	Great Read: This is a great book so far. I am a little farther than halfway into it and it is great. Although the writing is a little choppy at times, it is definitely worth it.
Positive	"Through the eyes of Bugliosi: This book truly lives up to what Vincent Bugliosi says on the first page of his book ""Helter Skelter-The True Story Of The Manson Murders""-- ""This story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you."" This is not only the best true crime book ever written, but it is the ONLY true crime story ever written. Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book."
Positive	Amazingly horrific: I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story.
Positive	"AMAZING!!: Helter Skelter was the absolute best true crime book I have ever read. From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the ""family"". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!"
Positive	"""Helter Skelter"": the Kindle edition review: All of the good things said about ""Helter Skelter"" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."
Positive	Mind Blower!: This book is absolutely riveting! It seems that only a couple of books a year can hold my attention like this one - which is a shame. I always have a sense of loss after reading a great book. The whole Manson paradigm is so bizarre and twisted that it just blows your mind. I read this book over a long rainy weekend and could not put it down. If you like fascinating stories where reality is stranger than fiction, this is THE book you should read. Top notch!
Positive	True crime written well: This book was a fast and intense page turner. It was scary and interesting since watching and reading the case in the news. The book was well written by the prosecutor. I recommend this as a read because it was one of the crimes of the century.
Positive	YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK: THIS AN AMAZING BOOK, I WAS VERY SPELLBOUND WHEN I READ THIS. ICANT BELIVE HOW ONE PERSON COULD BE SO SICK IN THE HEAD AND ALL THEKIDS HE HAS HAD IT IS GROSS. I HAVE DONE SO MUCH RESURCH ON MANSON FOR A CLASS PROJECT THAT I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN HE DOES. THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK IT WILL LEAVE YOU AMAZED. END
Positive	this has got to be the best book ive ever read: i read this book a little over a year ago when i was 14, this book was so good and it was told like a story not just from some 3rd person view, i felt like i was in the books world it was that good, this book kept getting more and more intriging as i turned the pages i think if i remeber correctly i finshed the book in 4 days, cause it was so damn good... i hella recomend this book to everyone, pretty scary too and i liked the pictures
Positive	reread of Helter Skelter: Many years ago, this was a popular,horrible event. Just wanted to read it again as an older person so see if my images had changed of the book.
Positive	Helter Skelter The Manson Murders: while this book is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book. On the whole a good read which reflects how things were at the time of the Manson Murders but ultimately a little unsatisfactory, somehow.
Positive	Some interesting moments.: 'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' is an examination of Charles Manson and his cult and the bizzare trial that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about. There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson. It is surprising that he was able to hold the power over those people like he did.
Negative	Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete: Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format.
Positive	great and insghtful: well written and informative. I finished the whole 689 page book in one week and three days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
Positive	Most interesting: This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
Positive	Surprisingly Witty!: I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry read. I was very pleasantly surprised at, not only how well-written, but how witty this book truly is! I even laughed out loud at some of Bugliosi's comments, which is astonishing considering the murderous content of the book.It really speaks for itself that after three decades, this book is still a literary staple!
Positive	"Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness: Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The ""family"" is truely an unbelievable group of people that absolutely butchered for the begining Helter Skelter. I would strongly recomend it to anyone."
Positive	DAWN'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER: Helter Skelter is a very interesting book. Almost every page keeps you on the seat of your chair. It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!
Positive	Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious: I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders.
Positive	"What else can I say? The definitive telling of the Manson murders.: ""Helter Skelter"" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."
Positive	Real Life Horror Story: This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history.
Positive	Good for the story itself, not the writing: This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song).
Positive	"READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!: This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an ""A""). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his ""family"". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."
Negative	bad book: it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole Manson murders. I have never been more bored with a book in my entire life.
Negative	"This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!: This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."
Positive	A masterpiece of cool jazz, funk and classical music: I just love this album. I have owned the original album since 1979 and when my eyes fell on the CD in one of our local shops about seven years ago now, I didn't have to think twice and bought it straight away. I still love to listen to it once every so often. The recording quality is just superb, especially on the acoustic recordings! A jazzfunk masterpiece, with a great rythm section (Andy Newmark and Ralph MacDonald), funky bass (Gary King), Bob James on keyboards and the cool and sophisticated flute of the man himself. Huberts interpretations of Ravel's 'Forlane' and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and Juliet' are just awsome. Played with tremendous virtuosity, perfect timing and outstanding deliverance! If you are in to jazz and funk but you love your classical music too, you are going to be hooked, I know I am!
Negative	extremely dull: I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading
Positive	A Good Book: This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author.
Positive	"Great ballads.: Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like ""I Got it Bad..."" ""Your Love Has Faded"" and ""Day Dream."" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."
Negative	Liver Cleanse Supplement: Did not use as my G.I. Dr. said that a recent study showed that they do not help.
Positive	A nowadays science-fiction: In 2081, a new kind of telescope, using subtle quantum effects, allows for a detailed examination of all the planets of the galaxy and abroad. Life is present everywhere, but not civilization. Subtle evidences show that civilizations are numerous, but that they disappeared... Where? What is our own enthralling future?This book is anticipation in the Jules Vernes style: bold but realistic prospects with nowaday 2000' science, some scientific popularization, without forgetting warm-hearted characters in an optimistic vision of life.Richard Trigaux, author.
Negative	Quit working after 3 hours: The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again. But I won't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again. I got a new laptop.
Positive	Well Written, with an Interesting Twist: This story was way more than just a romance novel. There was an element of time-travel involved that gave the story a whole new aspect. I enjoyed the book, and just wish it hadn;t ended where it did. If I'm not mistaken, there may be a sequel in the works. I would certainly want to continue the adventure.
Positive	Excelent: Very interesting read, if you love history you will love this book as I did. I could not put it down.
Positive	Good Book: A historical romance from the 1700's that tells of the true massacre of the French by the Natchez Indians. A good read.
Negative	"too long and boring read: This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the ""gentleness and thoughtfulness"" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."
Negative	Impossible: This set was so complicated that we are returning it. My 8 year old cannot figure it out nor can any of the adults who have tried. The instructions are incomplete. I really wanted to like this but it is so complex and the instructions are so poorly presented that we are sending it back - it just was not any fun and actually became really frustrating and chore-like to try to complete the first design. Finally, we gave up and repacked it all.
Negative	would be good if only there were directions: This kit has a building diagram for only 1 project and that diagram was so poor that my husband who played with these kkits as a kid in the 60s (yes they have been around that long) couldn't easily figure it out - and he rarely has trouble figuring out anything. Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions. I encourage the manufacturer to do so.
Negative	Impossible to use: I bought this for my 10 year-old son. He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail.
Positive	Older kids like it...: ...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!
Positive	excellent rollator/walker: This is a very good rollator. Very easy to adjust, very stable, rolls easily over grass and other uneven outdoor surfaces.The adjustable height seat is great.
Negative	Cosco Ability Care Traveler rollator: The rollator might have been en excellent one, and was keenly waited for.However, 2 days past it's expected latest arrival time, it had not arrived. The company that was supposed to send it admitted that they had printed the shipping label, notified Amazon and us that it had been shipped, but had not done so.They offered a pink one which was absolutely not suitable for the male user, so I demanded the money back, which they promptly did. I was underwhelmed by the professionalism of that company, and notified Amazon.com about it.
Negative	Not Happy: I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality.
Positive	I love my card holders: It makes so much easier to hold my cards and my friends like them very much. Thanks for selling this product.
Positive	great for kids and seniors: I bought these for myself because I have arthritis and it makes card playing much easier and more enjoyable. My elderly father also uses them. They're sturdy and stand by themselves.
Positive	So handy: This makes playing the game so much easier. You can view you cards at all times without straining your hands. Especially good if you have arthritis.
Positive	Helpers when playing cards: We play a card game that requires holding several cards. These card holders are a huge help. I really like having multiple colors.
Negative	Not new ,disappointed: I was surprised to see that the item was used. Advertised as new. Would have liked the new ones stead got used.
Positive	Set of four Free standing card holders: Haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I'm sure they will be just fine and work as expected.
Positive	Great for arthritic hands: I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it's difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. We used them over the holiday and they were a great hit.
Positive	Great for arthritic hands!: These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. Very easy to use.
Positive	expensive but well worth it.: These card holders are durable and large as well as ruggedly built. The design allows the card holder to be held or sat on a table during play.They cost more than smaller designs but for my money they are well worth it.
Positive	Very Handy: I play Hand and Foot every other week and the four of us love using these. You get 13 cards and it is very handy to have.
Negative	Don't buy: What ever you do don't buy this product. It not only came in used but beaten to death. It was scratch, dented and chipped. This is my 4th time writing a review on this product all other attempts have be block like I suspect this one will be to.
Negative	Watch the price: I bought this from the same co. before christmas and was stunned that the price had doubled. On the page the price was not clear!
Positive	war of the warewolf: Greenberg and Tuccille have written an old fachoned lycanthropic thriller with some amusing political undertones. Takes me back to the pleasures I encountered in watching Bela Lugosi. But Ludwig von Dracula is very different from Bela's Dracula!
Positive	Works Great: The biggest minus is having to remove the phone from the cradle and unplug the cord from the phone to remove from the car. Other than that minor inconvienence it works great
Negative	"OOPS! WRONG BOOK!!: This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of ""Dark and Stormy Night."" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized! Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word ""Execrable,"" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."
Negative	Pass On This One: For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!
Negative	All foam - no beer: I usually like Flint and have read everything he published. This is the biggest single book and by far the worst. The book is supposed to be a comedic fantasy. Maybe it is. If you are looking for a book where everything is supposed to be funny and nothing is to be taken seriously, maybe this is your book, but I pitched it after 66 pages.
Negative	put it down after a few chapters: Well I'm not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work.
Negative	Too wordy....: I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
Positive	Great product!: Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!
Positive	Great value - now: These once cost nearly $3000, but I got my z557 for about 1/15th of that. I've had it for over six months and used it for radio, TV, DVD movies, Internet video (full-screen HD) and general computing. With 2GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate, it actually runs really well. My keyboard isn't as bad as what was written about, here, but it is not the kind of keyboard you would use for more than surfing, anyway. And, it will take any USB keyboard or keyboard/mouse, wireless, or otherwise. I'd recommend using a wired LAN instead of its weak wireless. And, it can seem like it's running hot, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem. If you have the room, it's a decent all-around system, looks good and is nicely built.
Negative	"Utopian fantasy: Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.) His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various ""outsider"" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain ""outsider"" males are physically abused by the ""alpha males"" of the group. Look at the primary source texts and warlike art of civilizations from the Aztec to the Sumerians and you will see intolerance is a problem of the y-chromosome, not social conditioning from one particular society. Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems."
Negative	Found it Irritating: Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books.
Positive	"Yesteryear: I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it. The chacarters he builds in this book are great. It's a book to read when you wish to lay back and dream about how good ""US"" humans are .......and how fanatical some of ""US"" can be. If you enjoy Mr. Hogans books you will greatly enjoy this good story. I have read all of Mr. Hogan's books and enjoy them all. I can't wait to see where his next story will take me."
Positive	"Great Science Fiction: I read books for ""escapism"" and for the pleasure of reading. I'm not a political or social scientist, so evaluating a work of fiction on that basis is meaningless to me.Simply put... It's a very good story that is both easy to read and hard to put down. I loved it."
Negative	This book could have been good.: The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story.
Positive	A book to read again and again: A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'.
Negative	Do not buy. This is a BOOTLEG: Since when did Amazon have the legal right to sell bootleg CD's? I purchased this cd so I can listen to it in the car, ( I have had it on wax for 20 years)The CD is a CDR... When did Amazon buy the licensing rights to Music of Life? They are charging people $15.00 for a bunch of MP3's burnt on to a CD lmao. I give it one star because it is a CDR..
Negative	Poor Design, Construction & Quality: We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again.
Positive	One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.
Positive	Pretty entertaining: Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.
Positive	Wings Above the Diamantina: If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one. It is well written. Set in the Australian outback, the detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, is half white, half aborigine and makes full use of his native skills. He informs the reader of the progress he is making in solving the mystery as he discovers the clues, while still maintaining the suspense. This is an interesting and complex mystery.
Positive	"A must have for your CD collection!: This is a great CD! Ten originals along with excellent remakes of ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and ""I Can't Hold Hold Out"", both of which the band has molded into their own while keeping true to the original. Fans of Babylon AD will certainly not be disappointed!"
Positive	Jabra EarGels: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use.
Negative	Not worth the $2.99: I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.
Negative	Glad they were under ten bucks.: Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them.
Negative	Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.
Positive	Good Deal: Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping.
Positive	Jabra Eargels: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. The set consists of 3 pairs of eargel (three sizes). Found the size that fit and inserted the ICON. Works OK, but not as snug as I would like on my right ear. Tried the left ear one and it was much better; fit was better and sound was louder. Tried several types of earphone adapters, and these seem to work better than most. If you have a problem with fit on one ear, try the other one.
Positive	the keep my icon and my jabra extreme where they belong.: Works great, fits better. Works with a range of headsets. I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme. The gels are comfortable, and fit quite well. Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel. Th ese are almost the well fitting. Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months, but for the price I can live with that.
Negative	Completely Worthless: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.
Positive	Jabra ear gel: Product works perfectly with jawbone 2. Ease of use without needing to change anything on ear peice. Will need to decrease volume when using the nanda ear gel. Getting good fit easy with the differen sizes provided. Soft material makes comfortable for extended use , and no need for the ear loop.
Negative	Junk,Don't wast your money.: I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit.
Positive	Jabra EarGels: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.
Positive	Makes a Jawbone 2 better: I hated the fit of my Jawbone 2.0. It would never stay in no matter which ear loop or ear bud I used. Someone recommended these to me, so I thought I'd give them a try. After 2 months of using it, I'm pissed I didn't get them sooner. Before chucking your Jawbone 2.0, try these.
Positive	great product: people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them
Negative	THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS.: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.
Negative	POOR: GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.
Positive	Great Item: I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people. My only gripe is that they don't fit every single diffrent headset out there. They worked great for mine but I need a new one and I noticed that only about half of the bluetooth headsets out there will fit these.
Negative	Preset sizes just don't fit: The title says it all. Preset sizes of the EarGels just don't fit my ears. The tube that directs sound does not go in my ear canal far enough and the hook that is supposed to hold the unit in your ear will not hold it in mine. None of the 3 sizes of gels made a difference.Try before you buy if possible.
Negative	Didn't fit: Although good quality product, it doesn't fit my ear at all. None of the sizes fit comfortably or snug. I can't use it at all and just wasted my money.
Negative	Doesn't fit well at all, hard to get into ear.: I bought these to help with what I've read, to get the Jawbone to fit better. These ear pieces were hard to get into the ear no matter what size I tried. For a wireless earpiece you want to be able to get it on and off your ear quick if you need to, and these prevent you from doing so.
Negative	Not for my application: I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. The gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. These may be OK but not for my application.
Positive	You only need 1 size: I cannot find where to buy my size and which ear I use my eargel. What in the world are you supposed to do with 3 sizes and 3 sides when you most likely will only use 1 size and 1 side??The product is comfortable and without the use of a boom mike makes this product number 1, except for being able to buy the right size eargel replacements.
Negative	"Not a trustworthy company: I bought two sets of these. They're priced at $9.50. But, when they arrived, the price tag still stuck on the item says $2.99. Nice way to hide your ""shippign cost"" ($6.51) from your customers! This company goes on my ""Never Again"" list!"
Negative	"Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the ""flap"" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these."
Negative	waste of money: Absolute waste of money. What arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.I left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.Given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however I would never buy from these guys again.Am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.
Negative	didn't fit my ears: Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims...
Negative	Way too large!: Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.
Negative	To Big: These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.
Positive	excellent vendor: eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
Negative	Great for a few weeks: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.
Negative	Not compatible with Jawbone Icon: With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.
Negative	Terrible design: I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
Negative	Ear Gels: None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.
Negative	JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone.
Positive	Much needed: I bought these to go with the Jawbone 2 because the ear piece they use will not stay in your ear and the loops that go over your ear just does not fit.These are great and they set in your ear nicely.
Positive	Jabra Eargels Great Help for my Jawbone II: While I loved the sound of my Jawbone II headset, it would not remain secured with the eargels provided. These Jabra eargels work wonderfully and keep the headset comfortably and securely in my ear.
Positive	Solid upgrade for Jawbone: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.
Negative	Not for me...: These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device.
Negative	Worthless: None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
Negative	They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered.: DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative	How is this supposed to work?: I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.
Negative	"Not Recommended: I only have one word to say about it...""NOT RECOMMENDED""...but still you can go ahead & waste your $ 10 to find out...Good Luck"
Positive	"So much better than ""over the ear"": I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'."
Positive	Fits perfectly on my Jawbone headset: I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended.
Negative	bad fit, way too big: Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears.Jabra EarGels - ClearI suppose in theory they should work to channel the sound into your ear, but that's only if the pieces fits into your ear, I didn't get a chance to test that aspect.
Negative	Waste of money: This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
Negative	Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe: In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic.
Positive	I can hear!: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments. If you work or play anywhere it is loud, you need these! I have since upgraded these to a custom earpiece, but if I hadn't gotten the Jabra's, I most likely would have chucked the Jawbone as unusable!
Negative	don't buy: these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
Negative	Waste of money: These ear gels were supposed to fit easily on the Jabra Bluetooth that I have, but they don't stay on at all once they were placed on it. I was hoping the contoured shape would hold in my ears, but it just proved to be very uncomfortable.
Negative	Total Waste of Money: Not one of the ear gels worked. Feel like I got ripped off. The ear gels are headed to the trash can where they belong.
Negative	Does not fit jawbone 2 very well: I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. They did not fit very well and were very loose. I use the small size and they did not fit very well. The medium and large size do not fit my ear canal. Too bad as I need an in-ear bluetooth to hear well. I guess I will have to look for something else.
Negative	not compatable with the jawbone.: produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
Negative	They fit nicely in the ear, but don't work so well with jawbone: I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.
Positive	Works well with the Samsung WEP200: I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn't get them to stay in. these made it work!
Positive	Works well and comfortably.: I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size.
Positive	Instructions on how to use with Jawbone: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.
Positive	I need two sizes!: I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)
Negative	Jabra Ear Gels: I ordered the ear gels to go with my Jawbone Bluetooth headset. The problem that I see is that the ear gels are too bulky when combined with the Jawbone.
Positive	Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets.: Excellent product. I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.
Negative	Stick it in your ear!: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]
Negative	Liked the ear piece: I quess I ordered the wrong ones, did not fit my ear piece well. I've never been able to find any other pieces for this particular ear piece so I quess I just have to trash it.
Positive	BULK PACKAGING: These came in a tiny ziploc bag with no retail label. Not as big a deal as had this issue been instead with the headset that they are going with, but still... It'd have been nice to have known what to expect.
Negative	Thanks for nothing, Jabra: Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons
Negative	useless: For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product.
Negative	Far from perfect...: I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed.
Negative	Does not fit Jawbone Era: The specs for this product state that it universally fits all Jawbone headsets. It does not. It does not fit the Jawbone Era.
Positive	"Eargels for Jawbone retrofit: Using the Jabra eargels over my Jawbone.I can omit the ear hook, and it sounds much better than the manufacture's product.Looks a little scary out of the ear, but ears are not a ""manufactured item""."
Positive	Good: I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
Negative	These are not the answer to Jawbone Noise Asason: While Jawbone make a great blue tooth ear bud, it doesn't interface with ears well. The Jabra solution doesn't work. It doesn't hold the ear bud well allowing it to fall off at the most inconvieniant times. It also hurts your ear and is difficult to insert. It's not the answer, friends.
Positive	GREAT: The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are. Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..
Negative	"These don't work with Jabra BT250v headsets: I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine."
Negative	Jabra clear gel - useless: These were said to work great with the Jawbone blue tooth headset. They don't, are almost impossible to put on and do not stay on the headset. I think they are useless for the Jawbone.
Positive	Very good.: These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras?
Negative	Old and yellowed: Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again.
Negative	Ripoff ! Don't Buy From CMMA Accessories !: I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund. Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !
Positive	Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.
Positive	Very functional, not very pretty: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.
Positive	It's a keeper!: I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic.
Negative	"Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION: The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
Negative	Poor excuse for a great story: I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey.
Positive	"Mythological Fiction: This film is one of the better of this genre--due to the casting, and the more ""true to life and literature"" approach that is taken. The characters seem much more ""human."" Enough sexual content, albeit well done, to preclude viewing by even teenagers. Homer's story is followed pretty faithfully, too, from my distant memories. But the real ""excellence"" is in the acting."
Negative	Oh boy... dont let this spoil your opinion of Homer: The origional creater of The Odyssey, Homer, did a wonderful job producing an action-packed story where you cared about the characters and made you eager to know what would happen next. Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...
Negative	absolutely HORRIBLE: I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer.
Negative	"Cmon ""honors"" people!: the movie was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. alice's was good, those were her words, but kayla, jana...we were all there when noteboom said what you wrote and you're taking credit for it? please!"
Positive	Excellent, Exhilirating, and Fun: And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS.
Positive	Great translation from print to screen! Worth buying a copy: It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. No viewing time not well-spent with the lavish production design, brilliant acting, and not-off-tangent-from-literature screenplay. I hope they release a DVD version right away.
Negative	"WOW: Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
Negative	Uhh..... Were they stoned?: This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!
Negative	Uggh: Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew
Negative	Mullets across the Med: I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney.
Negative	More like a NEGATIVE 3: This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!
Negative	I agree: I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is
Negative	coulda been betta!!!!!!!!: the special effects sucked and we've seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of movies we've seen it was pretty crap. it was realy BORING! (...) we've seen and weve seen heaps of them and some of them were realy gory over all COULDA BEEN BETTA!!!!!
Negative	"Blech: This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
Positive	Still compelling after 3000 years.: Homer would have endorsed this rendering of his tale. Full of wonderful special effects, gorgeous Mediterranean vistas, and gods and goddesses who look their parts, this movie is still driven by personalities. The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters. There is a reason that Homer's story still reaches us after 3000 years, and this telling does justice to its ancient material.
Positive	adventurous. suspenseful. mythological.: The Odyssey was about the greek hero Odysseus' journey home from his victory of the trojan war. He encounters many perils on his voyage. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FANTASY , THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.
Positive	kewl!: The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking.
Negative	THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful
Negative	Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too.: NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****
Negative	Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny: Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked.
Positive	Odyssey (VHS): I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. I ordered it the day before Thanksgiving, and it was shipped out to me the Friday after. It arrived in good condition in plenty of time for me to review before using it in the class room.
Negative	Agonizingly Long: Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating.
Negative	Movie is awesome. Service comperable to Wal-Mart: I already know that I will love the movie. The problem is, shpping is and always has been a deceit. Even f you pay for next day (Prime Member), you will not get it on time. There is no other solution for law-abiding people.
Positive	The odyssey: I thought that the Odyssey was a very good movie.It was well put together, and had great acting.The effects of the movie were average.I especially enjoyed the scenes with the cyclops.Although its a very interesting movie I believe that it is too long, and the audience/viewers gets bored.In general I thought that it was a great movie that was educational, and was very succesful.By Josh 7R.
Positive	"Reasonable interpretation of a classic: When you start with such good material, it's hard to please everyone. Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" many reviewers are disappointed that the movie didn't match their own visions of a great book. (Notice how no one ever complains that ""Goldfinger"" or other Bond movies are significantly different from the Ian Fleming novels?) Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects ""good enough."" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special ""Walking with Odysseus!"" Sheesh!"
Positive	Good: I saw this movie for first time having missed it when it first aired. I thought the special effects were amazing and my favorite sequence was the cyclops. The scene where the ship goes over the edge was very amazing, after that the story just seemed to grind to a halt. Much to long and boring after the first hour and a half. But well worth the rental if you like special effects.
Negative	Great book; terrible movie: if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!
Positive	"Homer's enchanting tale: Homer's enchanting tale is brought to life in ""The Odyssey.""I, a student, first saw this movie while studying Ancient Greece with my class. On the first day of Ancient Greece, my teacher popped the video in the VCR and made us take catagorized notes.Since it was our first day we had no idea about Greece's history, gods and goddesses, heroes or political science.However, the Odyssey told my class and I a great deal about Greece.One of the reasons why I reccommend this movie, is your (or your child, for that matter) don't know too much on Ancient Greece, you put the movie in the VCR, and 2 hours done with the credits rolling, you will know so much about Ancient Greece.It occured to me that in this movie The Odyssey about Odysseus leaving Ithaca for the Trojan war and fight the curse of Poseidon, underneath it all there is the political science and the goddesses and gods history and way of life and the scenery.Over all this is an amazing movie."
Positive	Great for the classroom: This video is great to use as a resource for teaching The Odyssey. The students find the video entertaining and helpful. However, the movie does not exactly follow the original Odyssey. Of course, the directors took some creative liberty on certain scenes. On the whole, the movie does a great job in giving students an account of the journey of Odysseus.
Positive	Good: I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often. However, I loved it as a movie, not necessarily as an adaptation of The Odyssey, which is one of my favorite books.
Negative	"NOT a good representation of Homer: I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."
Negative	Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century: It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind.
Negative	"OMG! worst movie ever!: haha . . . wow this is one of those movies that is so completly bad that its funny. ok 1st of all Odysseus accent changes in almost every scene. 2nd penelope pronounces telemachos different than Odysseus. 3rd telemachos sounds like a whiney english boy. 4th posiedon ""the god of the wine dark sea"" is a face in a wave. 5th anitkleia is just freaky. 6th Odysseus beard changes color. 7th the cow scene wasnt even in there. 8th THEY NEVER LET PENELOPE HAVE HER REVENGE! 9th telemachos cant do any thing but then amazingly he can throw 2 spears at once. 10th Aoilos sounds like a cartoon. 11th the characters are all supposed to be bueatiful but they are all ugly . . . and i can go on. NOTEBOOMS 1/2 ROX! haha SPACE NEEDLE!"
Negative	Lord, have mercy!: If this movie were worse (and if it COULD be) there would undoubtedly be an unhealthy number of premature deaths .... First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say. Just DON'T watch this movie before (or even after) you read the book, unless you wish to perish at an unnaturally early stage in life!!!!!!!!GOODBYE!!!!!!!!
Negative	Awful, just awful: Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.
Negative	Who be dissin on our noteboom?: Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself.
Positive	Falwed but Fun none the less: I love Greek History and mythology. When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time.
Positive	Out of date, but good: _Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children.
Positive	The ONLY translation of Schure's play...: **This is the only book that Schure's masterful drama is given in an English translation.**This book is so rare, and I mean so rare that I had to go to a small town called Dornach in Switzerland to find it!!!And of course, it is out-of-print, and so unknown that it will probably never be re-printed again in history....not to say even performed, unless a Schure enthusiast like myself undertakes a task like that!This is the play that the philosopher Rudolf Steiner took as the model to his own 4 Mystery Dramas. Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner. A wonder and deep inspirational experience.
Positive	My son loves it: Great language, humor and wonderful story telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell's books. Always enjoy reading them. I got thisfor my son on his 11th birthday. I think it will also help himgreatly improve his vocabulary.
Positive	My family and other animals: I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!
Positive	works great: This mold is great for what I need. Chocolate pops right out of the plastic. would buy again if needed
Negative	Can't get worse: This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
Negative	"Nauseating: In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
Positive	"The Coolest: I wore this shirt to work one Friday (casual day) and one the my co-workers told me ""I've worked here 7 years and that is the coolest shirt I've ever seen."" Need I say more."
Positive	Two fro the price of one: This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. The first half is what I consider a small Big Band. With other Sax players, trumpets and guitar. The second half is the Rollins Trio. With that said I simply Love this CD., Grand Street is my favorite song, it instantly lights up the whole room. The sound is tight and powerful. I do prefer the first half with it's rich full sound. The second half is good but less attention getting. The playing however is excellent. For a great mix of styles and sound on one CD your cannot lose with this one.
Positive	Excellent Product: This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods. The only issue is that you can't get it too hot; if you want to add it to soup, you've got to let it cool a bit first.
Negative	Bad memory leakes: The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. The only problem I've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo. If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management. The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it wouldn't happen again. Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try. I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue.
Positive	ORIGINAL SURF MUSIC FROMTHE 60'S: THE IMPACTS WERE ANOTHER SOCAL SURF BAND FROM THE EARLY 60'S THAT USED TO PLAY AT THE BALBOA BALLROOM ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER GREAT BANDS FROM THAT TIME (DICK DALE AND THE DEL-TONES, THE CROSSFIRES, SENTINALS, TORNADOS, AND A LOT OF OTHER ONES AS WELL.) AND RECORDED ON THE LOCAL DEL-FI LABEL ON LOW BUDGET RECORDS. THIS IS A GREAT CD OF EARLY 60'S SURF MUSIC, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF WIPE OUT.
Negative	RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris: Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks.
Negative	Mirror came damaged and late: After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
Negative	dont buy from them: They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. Thier 1-800 # will not let you talk to any one. I left messages and no response. I real close to file a complaint with the BBB. Dont buy.LB
Negative	below average: I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it.
Positive	Good Concert: Always been a Cocker fan and this one will not disappoint. Given the age of this concert the sound and picture quality is OK...would rock in blue ray however!
Positive	Good DVD: Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!
Positive	great show, worth buying: Great audio and video with many hits. Only gripe would be that they turned up the audience clapping very loudly after each song and a little too loudly during the songs. This is only a small criticism, however. Buy this DVD.
Positive	Useful: Needed for class. It got the job done. Interesting book and I'm glad I had to read it. Would recommend.
Negative	"Bait & Switch - Completely misleading picture: I too got taken in by the ""coiled"" picture. I got a curly cable, not the straight cable pictured ""in a coil."" Completely misleading, I lost my $3.99 that I paid for next day shipping from Prime as well! Total bait & switch. I didn't read the one review on it. Now there are two. This cable is actually about 2 feet long with the coil."
Positive	This is a keeper for sure: I have personally used this edition of the Psalms for quite a while. Because I enjoy it so much I have purchased several copies for friends
Positive	"rated comparatively with Wilbur's others: i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."
Negative	The Diamond Hunters: This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either.
Negative	The Diamond Hunters: Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. I would rate his Monsoon and the early Courtney triliogy as 4-5 stars.
Negative	The Diamaond Hunters: When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth.
Negative	Totally Unbelievable Tale: This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.
Positive	Less than Smith is capable of doing.: Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover.
Positive	Love Wilbur Smith: What a great writer. Wilbur Smith could write about wallpaper and I would find it interesting. I just wish more of his books were available on Kindle since I will no longer by a paperback....
Negative	Poorly Made: What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
Positive	Dangerous Mail Service: So often we see in westerns the stagecoach roaring into town and well-dressed easterners get out--not even dusty. This book shows the real and extremely difficult days of the stagecoach mail delivery and does it in a very factual, well-documented way. The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities. It was especially interesting to me since my father and brother have the same name--Ben Holladay. He may be a distant relative and we would be proud to claim him.
Positive	Very Action packed and cool: I like this movie. I like the part when Moby Dick attacks. I think the captain is weird.
Positive	In good condition: Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.
Negative	"I was rooting for the whale in this one: Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
Negative	1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles: So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.
Positive	"Why is Fedellah Asian?: I love the book, Moby Dick. Yes, that does make me a freak of nature.One of my favorite characters is Ahab's harpooner/attendant demon Fedellah who was completely ignored in the John Huston/Ray Bradbury movie version, but, alas and alack, this Fedellah not only does not have a great white mane worn like a turban on his ""Persian"" head in this movie but he is a bald Asian with a Fu Man Chu mustache.I know. Picky, picky, picky. And Flask has a pipe not Stubb. Alas. Still, it has fairly wonderful production values and if you don't have a Fedellah fetish, you'll probably like this one. Queequeg rocks."
Positive	Overall, an excellent movie.: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not having read Melville's book, this movie gave me much more of an understanding of Ahab and his tortured soul than the Gregory Peck version. Excellent acting by Stewart and the rest of the cast. My only complaint is with Moby Dick himself - the rubber whale used in the scenes is not very convincing.
Positive	Highly entertaining: I guess I'm in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining.
Negative	"A pitiful excuse for a movie: If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
Positive	"Moby Dick: Movie was great but the sub-titles were ""off"" and distracting (but hilarious at times!) Just finished reading the book, and the movie was pretty acurate. Anything with Patrick Stewart is ""quality"" in my book and I wasn't disappointed here. It was great to include Gregory Peck, also, and liked the special features with him after the movie."
Negative	"Patrick Stewart and the 7 Dwarfs: Boy, what a lousy Moby Dick! Patrick Stewart is terrific. That is it, period. The effects with the whale are fine, but when the cabin boy is drowning, the water is only up to his chest. When will the REAL Moby Dick be on DVD? Now that the Coen Brothers have paid tribute with the ending of ""Oh Brother"", one can get one's hopes up again. Save your money for that."
Negative	Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!: Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!
Negative	TERRIBLE MOVIE: What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!
Positive	"awesome: I thought Patrick Stewart did a fantastic job. He showed great feeling towards ""The great white whale"". I have seen this movie 3 times and I still enjoy watching it. It was much better than I was expecting. I wish this movie had been around years ago when I had to read the book in school, it would have given me a better perspective of it. also it would have made the book easier to read. I loved the movie!"
Negative	"Classics never die!: If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only."
Negative	"Simply awful: I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
Positive	Round Perditions Flames: I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Though the film looses a star for the quite dodgy special effects, Herman Mellville's story and A cast of great actors lift it up into a classic.
Negative	Weak remake: I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
Negative	DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM,SEE THE HOUSTON 1956 ONE!: Between lousy directing, and pointless wide camera angles, and a total disreagard to the book, (Unlike previous film and TV episodics) this was so bad, that I forced myself to sit through the entire video, just to see if it ever got better, or resembled the book in any way. I don't think anyone read the book on this production, or even bothered to read the cliff notes. A real waste of the actor's time, and ours.
Negative	DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION: It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something.
Negative	strong smell of oil: This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
Positive	Favorably impressed!: This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one.
Negative	Long term owner: Had this for 3 years. It isn't much to look at, doesn't heat as strong as Delonghi TRD0715T i own. But worst of all it started to leek on the second year. ..Not recommended..
Positive	good heat, cheap wheels: I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). While assembling the wheels, one literally shattered in my hands. I brought it back for a new one and the same thing happened. The third one assembled fine, and the store gave me 3 spare wheels, just in case. I don't know if I would have shipped two of them back to Amazon.It throws quite a bit of heat for such a small unit. We bought this to replace an older radiator of the same design and the difference is striking. I also noted a bit of an oil smell, but that went away after a few uses. All in all, a good heater, but
Negative	Poor Product: This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours.
Negative	Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting....: The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!
Negative	"Pretty Corny: I've read several other Deborah Smith books. In my opinion Blue Willow was the best. Sweet Hush was by far the corniest book, I've read in a long time. The phrase ""Sweet Hush"" must have been at used at least 100 times in the book. The main character ""Hush"" was predictable and one dimentional. If you enjoy Deborah Smith books, I would skip this one."
Positive	One of the best from Deborah Smith: I have enjoyed a few books from this author, but this one, was one of my favorites. I could not put it down to see where the story line was going and I was not disappointed! Love the strong characters and the flow of the story.
Positive	Deborah Smith: Read her, you will enjoy your time with her characters. Strong women, strong men, some bizarre quirks in lots of characters.
Positive	Great Book: This book is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader. I laughed out loud while reading because Ms Smith uses comical pharses I have grown up hearing. This is an awesome book.
Negative	review by Tarek musslimani: This is an absolutely not useful book. It is not understood at all and it is written so that no body can understand it but the author himself. So I do not recommend for you to buy it. Please save your money.TM
Positive	excellent book: In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening.
Negative	A nice companion to McQuarrie's text: I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book.
Positive	No better place to start with Stat Mech: If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists
Positive	great handbook: i'm a student of applied chemistry and this book has everything you need too know as undergraduate of statistical thermodynamics
Negative	Don't Bother: Don't bother. It is next to impossible to get this product to work. Tried everything (USB, download driver, etc.) and nothing worked - with XP Pro. ended up in the trash.
Negative	Dreadful.: Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful.
Negative	A disappointment: Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed.
Negative	"Not my cup of tea: This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never ""come clean"" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?"
Positive	Perry is now two times as classy!: William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon
Negative	This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever.: To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander.
Positive	"Sho and Jean are good together: When I first saw this movie had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it.I knew that Sho was.Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good.JCVD really out classed Sho in this one.I give them both 10's anyway.The way that they interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie will like this one.It's not just a martial arts movie."
Negative	Boring. Watch at your own risk.: Lets cut to the chase. If u want a better van damm movie. Watch no retreat no surrender. As for this one.save it for a day u got nothing better to do.its a time killer. If your just sitting around.lets get to the point.watch this one only if u need a time killer. If u want a movie with the sickest fights watch guyver2 .yall love it.and this one shelve it.
Negative	Van Damme gives the best performance,: which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though.
Negative	worst action movie ever: Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie
Negative	Van Damme's a Bad Guy ?: I would say the plot is good, but the action and fighting scenes are not in favour for action-movie goers.
Negative	"Where did the producers put all the money in Black Eagle?: First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this movie is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph! Plus the dvd features are limited and there is NO ""Making of..."" feature, only a theatrical trailer and some production notes (too short). Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD."
Negative	Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting: Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
Negative	I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt.
Positive	Little dated, but great: Zaller turns our perception of polling data on its ear. People don't think about most issues until they are asked, so opinion surveying might actually do more to shape opinions than actually report on them.
Negative	"Didn't work...I have to start again: My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
Positive	Flea control: This is a great product and I have used it for years. It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control.
Negative	create your own flea circus: I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well.
Positive	good product: Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. thanks for the good deal
Positive	Adequate: The springs on this hanger are a bit tight. It will accomodate plates of the sizes indicated. I have purchased other holders that are more flexible, and will hold a wider range of sizes. All in all, it does the job.
Positive	Blues-psych, somewhat like Cream: 1969 blues-psych. Reminds me of Cream though not as good. Singer is Scottish and really has the accent at times. Good if you like this type of music.
Positive	Great Acid Rock!: Haven't purchased this, but having listened to the whole album, I sure will!. I suggest any fan of acid rock/heavy psych, hard rock, classic rock, blues rock, or early heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath get this album today.
Positive	SOLID METAL!!: Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! \m/\m/
Negative	A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran: This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not.
Positive	Great Cards: This is an amazing deck of cards. They are very easy to use with some practice and you can fool anyone into thinking you are a true magician. This is a great buy for anyone who likes card tricks. It is lots of fun.
Positive	great for the price: Bought this for my husband for christmas. He has a MATTHEWS switchback compound bow. It fits nicely in this case without having to remove the quiver from bow. Has velcro ties to hold bow on bottom, sits on top of padding. Top has section to hold your arrows. Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside. Very good case for the cheap price.
Positive	would be 4.6 out of 5: For a cheap bow case, it really lives up to its name. I've traveled a few times to test it out and no problems what so ever! You get what u paid for.I have a mission craze bow and it fits well. There's room for everything i need to put in it!Cons and Problems-A little flimsy and doesn't seem too sturdy. And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy.
Positive	Plano Compact Bow Case: For the price its an excellent bow case. Not made for abuse. Don't know how it would do as baggage on an airline flight tho.
Positive	Excellent: The book which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking book by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. It is both intelligent and entertaining, as a book on popular music should be. Highly recommended.
Positive	"Great latin disco: I have only gotten interested in disco in the last few years, but now I am a huge fan. some of my faves include: Salsoul 12"", P&P Records Best of, Disco Connection Series, best of WestEnd, & 12"" Grand Series. However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers. Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music."
Positive	"Not quite Gone with the Wind.: It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."
Positive	Wonderful!: I first read this book in 1962. Today, I can remember the characters as if I had read the book yesterday. A beautiful love story written in a gentler time. A story that will tear at your heart and conscience. Very moving!
Negative	inside not as good as the cover: The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes.
Positive	A book that long? Are you kidding me?: Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list.
Negative	Weak: This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better.
Negative	Sad: Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help.
Negative	"It drags: I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile."
Negative	Mercedes wrote this?: I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!
Negative	Dishonest!: A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.
Positive	Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History: Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment.
Positive	JUST GREAT: So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back.
Negative	Ok at best: I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book.
Negative	This book has already been written: Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!
Negative	Too many cooks: The book had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. The characters were as flat as the paper they were writen on. The authors collaboration worked as well as a mixture of a heavy smoker in a fireworks factory. It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor. If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous. I enjoyed other works by the authors and am severly disapointed in this collaboration.
Negative	This is Merovingian Nights ,not a new book: mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery.
Positive	Fantastic!: Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!
Positive	Tells of a Venice where magic is alive: Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint & Dave Freer's Shadow Of The Lion is set in 1537 and tells of a Venice where magic is alive and two vagabond brothers are posed to influence its changes. A monster has been loosed on the city; and it's up to an unlikely band of individuals to join in defeating the danger.
Negative	an OK read, but not what I expected: I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them. It has alot of plot & story, and it can be difficult to keep track of at times. Its not a BAD read, its just... very busy, with many many many characters. It was an OK read, but not what I expected.
Positive	Wonderful book: I love this book, it has different kinds of projects that you'll enjoy, and the charts are neat, I love it!!!!!!
Negative	Disappointing: Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy.
Positive	"Unheard talent: Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their ""Heart Of The Ages"" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia."
Positive	Keeping Irelands History Alive Through Song: This CD captures the essence of how the Irish Soldier, during the War Between The States, passed on their history from Ireland. Prison Ships is an EXCELLENT song telling us how the Irish were persecuted and sent far from their homes to Australia. This is a great original effort along with Soldier Boys, Angelus Bells, Welcome, and the title track Rock of Erin. I think the 69th Pa did a superb job with their first effort. ALL proceeds go towards Civil War Battlefield Preservation and Educational Projects that the 69th Pa are well known. This CD is a pleasant change from the other Civil War CDs available. If you like traditional Irish Music, this one is a MUST. Keep up the good work.
Negative	"A couple of positives. . .: . . .but not nearly enough to counter the negatives.First the positives:1) Some brilliant photography. One just can't get around this.2) Some truly likeable characters and character development -- especially several of the minor characters.There! That is two stars worth!Negatives:1) Spotty directing, which offsets the quality of the photography2) No earthly resemblance at all to the (true) book from which the story is supposed to have been taken3) A boring, and over-the-top gay agenda (along with any one of a number of similar ""far-left"" issues, poorly cobbled together4) A view of the Virgin Mary, which, while not openly portrayed offensively in the film, is bound, nonetheless to offendIn short, the bad outweighs the good. Skip this one."
Negative	This is a bad one: This is a really bad movie. The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona. This film entirely misses the point of the book and I just hope the author was well paid for allowing her book to be associated with this awful movie.
Negative	Terrible: Typical Hollywood movie trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. This movie is slow and does not even make much sense at all. Hopefully most people do not live like this and if they do they would be considered weird.Do not waste your time with this movie!
Negative	Under the tuscan sun: to be honest I expected a little more from the movie. it was too mellow and somewhat boring.
Positive	leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this movie at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this movie. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on thier luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. I laughed, I cried several times this movie evoked that youthful part inside me that needs to be awakened every so often. With the beautiful cinematography and portrayal of the people you want to leave your seat and hop a plane for Tuscany. I heard so many people saying that as they left the theatre. Go see this movie and laugh and cry all at the same time.
Negative	A great idea!: Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery.
Negative	Stinks: This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
Negative	Disappointing: Having read Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this movie was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful story became a run of the mill chick flick. As beautiful as the scenery was, the movie made Tuscany lose it's charm and warmth that I received in the book.
Positive	Very Uplifting and Fun: I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring.
Positive	Heart warming movie: I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.
Negative	YAWN!: I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book; however, the movie shares only a passing resemblance to the book. It gets 2 stars because I enjoy Diane Lane and Tuscany is gorgeous, but other than that the movie was dull, Lane's character is nothing short of pathetic, and the ending is trite.
Negative	Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.: Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book.
Positive	Enjoyable escapism: Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!
Positive	Movie night: Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase.
Negative	Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual.
Negative	The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!: Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read.
Negative	Terrible stinker!: What a stupid movie! There was nothign admirable in the main character. What the heck was she thinking in sleeping with a man she hadn't even known for a day! That is not realistic at all. The whole storyline had no logical sequence. Stay away from this movie.
Positive	Good Movie: I love the full screen edition of the movie. I do not like the movies that is half screen. I like this movie because it reminds me that there is life after divorce or any other life altering event. But we have to move forward to achieve it.
Negative	Couldn't Watch: I have been looking for this movie for a long while. It came and I put it in to watch it; it stopped playing 3/4 of the way through!!! I tried it in all of our devices and it did the same thing each time! Very disappointed!!!
Positive	A Very Pleasant Story: Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
Positive	Feel Good Movie: Absolutely loved this movie. Great message ... unbelievably good things can happen ... even later in life. Breathtaking views of Italy ... This movie never loses its magic.
Negative	If you read the book, don't watch the movie!: I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me.
Negative	If you liked the book, you will not like this film.: Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film.
Positive	The biggest surprise of the year! This film is a marvel!: We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are. It sure makes a great date movie - Under The Tuscan Sun is a marvel!
Negative	Guys miss this one: Gentlemen miss this movie. As a married man I am consigned to the fact that I must watch certain movies that are geared towards the ladies, I am okay with that. Having suffered through most of said type of movies, I can say that this particular movie is a truly a painful experience without any humor to help. All this movie does is follow a sad and lonely woman around Italy and waste the two hours that is the movie running time. Do not buy this movie for the lady in your life because then you will be forced to watch it.
Positive	One of the best chick flicks ever: Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!
Positive	Relationships in Tuscany: This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!
Positive	Quite a change from the book: Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume.
Negative	Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot: Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?
Positive	"Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon: This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just ""fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you"". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment."
Positive	Great Movie: My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!
Positive	Great movie for you and your gal friends to watch together!: Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!
Positive	Enjoyable & Light: When I go to the movies, I go to relax and enjoy a break from everday life. Who cares if it is realisitc or not. Being a romantic comedy buff, I found this movie entertaining and refreshing. Anyone who wants to enjoy a light movie will enjoy this film.
Negative	Boring!!!: This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. I could see the potential for comedy, but it just wasn't there. Maybe it's Diane Lane or maybe it's the director. I kept wondering if Lane was playing a teenager or an adult. I couldn't get involved with the character at all. She seemed to be faking it all the way through. I would've given no stars, but I thought the Italian countryside deserved at least 1 star.
Positive	Charming surprise...: This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day.
Positive	Opposing View of Divorce: The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets.
Negative	Undercover?: I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth.
Positive	Good flick: Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less.
Negative	Boring: This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it.
Negative	Are you KIDDING ME????: Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller book to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. What a shame! While I liked Diane Lane I was completely disappointed in this movie.
Negative	Boring, Drawn Out Movie: I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER.
Positive	Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines!: A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie.
Positive	Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining: Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!
Negative	"Stupid movie: I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story had no sense of direction. It seemed too badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were just adding more things as they went along, saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the married real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
Negative	"If it was not for Diane Lane....: If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as ""romantic comedy"", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!"
Negative	Tuscany steals the show: This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up.In short, I think ANY movie would benefit from being set and shot in Tuscany Italy. This one did. Without the beautiful backdrop - I don't think I would have watched the whole thing. A patchwork story-line, left me with the feeling that it had a lot of interesting bits and pieces BUT it appeared that they were put together for no apparent reason.It just wasn't believable.Maybe rent it
Negative	Diane Lane feast...: Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere.
Negative	Ho-Hum: One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!
Negative	barely cosi cosi (so so): This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book.
Negative	"Cute but typical: So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
Positive	Great movie!: Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role.
Negative	Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.
Negative	not worthy to be a chick flick: First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first.
Negative	"Gutless garbage: ""Under The Tuscan Sun"": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."
Negative	A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE': Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative. Lets just say that if you want to see Diane Lane at her best, Unfaithful is a better bet.If you enjoy film that insults your intellect while shooting pretty scenes country side, then by all means enjoy!
Negative	Trite, weak, thin, fake, demeaning,: The story is probably a wonderful love story; but, to get there you must suffer through the paper-thin character of a woman with no depth, no self, no mind..., or an actor who cannot portray a woman worth watching and not worthy of real love.
Negative	"Families / Christians BEWARE: I rented this movie thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean movie that I could enjoy watching. However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of ""If it feels good, do it."" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."
Negative	Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.
Negative	"Good Fun?: This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
Positive	A Woman finds herself in Italy: Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed. Her best friend realizes this and because of her pregnancy cannot go with her lover on a romantic tour of Tuscany, so they offer her the tickets for the trip instead.At first Francis does not want to go to Italy, but eventually decides to go. She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over
Positive	Is this really a 'chick flick'??????: I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy.....Diane Lane is a favorite of mine. Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all.
Negative	IS OK...I GUESS: THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE.
Positive	Not Bad...for a chick flick: Interesting!! This film takes place in Italy and surrounds itself with a character who recently gets divorced, and finds herself, at the urging of her friends (who happen to be gay) to get away from it all and take sometime to herself...little do they all know (including her) that she ends up going out there, and never coming back to the States to live. This is a story of a woman who is looking for more in life than just the normal basic stuff. She wants to live her life to the fullest and really enjoy what the world has to offer her. Good film, great message for all!!
Positive	Under the Tuscan Sun: If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico.
Positive	Diane Lane and Under The Tuscan Sun: This is a good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as Julia Robert's feminist 'Mona Lisa Smile' and being sometimes confused with that film by critics. This is not a feminist, male-bashing movie. And it isn't entirely a 'chic flick' either. Diane Lane is apparently very picky about the roles she plays and the films she appears in. This is another good choice for her.There are plenty of reviews here telling what this film is about. I'll simply tell you that I bought the DVD for my wife, but I usually watch it with her. It is a good movie.
Positive	Uplifting and Beautiful: The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting.
Negative	OH MY GOD!: One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???
Negative	Make Sure the Format is in Your Region: I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed.
Positive	"Lightweight but enjoyable: A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a ""Mediterranean"" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la ""This Old House.""OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."
Negative	"For MEN only: maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
Negative	"Under the Tuscan Sun: This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we're supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn't ""get"" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the 'man' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a 'family' that our protagonist always wanted in theory. Gimmie a break. This movie rates one star because the scale doesn't go lower."
Negative	Boooring.....: This was the most boring movie and the most wretched performance I have ever seen from Diane Lane. All she did was sigh through the first 45 minutes.
Positive	It was pretty good, but could have been better.: I gave this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie. However, it is quite depressing at times. Diane Lane just can't catch a break. It is kinda slow, but I'm very pleased to have seen it.
Positive	A really fun, smart and sexy movie!: This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!
Positive	The most entertaining film of the year: This movie was so entertaining. I was in stitches from laughing so much - it was so funny and enjoyable. Diane Lane was incredible in this film. She is such a good actress and here she proves that she is funny as well. This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year. Brilliant stuff!
Negative	wrong formAt: I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
Positive	Beautiful story!: This movie is based loosely on the true story of France Mayes. It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery. All of the characters are perfect!I also stumbled on to a daily planner based on the story... filled with gorgeous pics and quotes, stories, and recipes from Frances. So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!
Positive	delightful and quirky: I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Anyone who has ever undergone a painful divorce will relate to this movie. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I did not feel that Lane's acting was overdone. The angst of betrayal and divorce is just that, angst.The movie also had its delightfully quirky moments and while it was heavily salted and peppered with typical love story fare, it was also full of marvelous insights.Life marches on and there are opportunities at every turn.
Negative	Beautiful scenery, but thats about all: Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing.
Negative	Dismal: I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?
Negative	Non vero Italia!: This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda.
Negative	"If you liked this movie, you might have a brain damage: Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
Negative	Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century?: I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
Negative	Terrible movie, Great scenery: From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!
Positive	Great Blu Ray Presentation: Didn't see the BD review on Blu-ray.com so thought I write a quick one. Just watched the BD version this week and actually very happy and impressed by the transfer and DTS audio. Would give the video a 4.5 stars out of 5, and audio 5 out of 5. The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.Perhaps just a slight downside and that is the BD clarity and details do make Diane Lane look a tad older than she needs to be.But, still a great release and worthy purchase.
Negative	Propoganda: This is another movie in the long line of movies trying to shove homosexuality down our throats. Conveniently they don't mention the premis anywhere, making it look like a normal movie that you might like to rent. If you have any morals at all, don't waste your money on the gay agenda.
Negative	BORING!!!: I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!
Negative	Cliche city, what was Diane Lane thinking?: Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times. I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone. I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace. Watch it for that alone.Definitely disappointed with this.
Positive	Diane Lane shines in this wonderful movie!: Oscar nominee DIANE LANE shines in this wonderful comedy about changing your life for the better after a devastating blow. The film is wonderfully made, very funny, very sexy, and beautiful to look at. The scenery is breathtaking and the acting by DIANE LANE is tremendous. This is a very, VERY highly recommended film and the DVD looks like it has some cool extras as well! 5 stars!
Positive	Horowitz takes a wrecking ball to the Left: In How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas, Horowitz uses ruthless intellect to demolish the foundations upon which the new Left has tried to rebuild itself following the collapse of communism across the world.After reading this book you have to ask how Bill Clinton and Tony Blair can sleep at night.Used as a campaign blueprint, How to Beat the Democrats offers conservatives the tools to take on the Left in electoral combat which have been sadly lacking over the last decade.
Positive	Alas, if only the GOP would listen to him.: There is no room for RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) in our fight to win over the general population concerning the merits of conservative principles. Horowitz's book documents the fact that rightward ideas are winning ideas and will resonate with voters across the nation. This is a collection of essays, and, for the most part, they are brilliant. Two chapters, The War Room and How to Beat the Democrats, should be very influential upon politicians and the average reader. He preaches tactics and strategies that conservatives must hear and internalize. Important points are that politics are emotional and they should always be about hope. Republicans would be wise to learn from the words of this master. Ten more Horowitz's and the country would be in a much better place. He speaks his mind in beautiful prose and you'll turn these pages quickly. This is a highly recommended choice, indeed.
Negative	"Gene: Dated. Doesn't tell ""how to beat the Democrats..."" Old, worn advice. Save your money and buy something else."
Negative	More of the same: If you feel passionately about politics and whether having a republican in office or a democrat will make one tiny bit of difference, then go ahead and buy the latest addition to this seemingly endless genre.For those of us with kids who fear for the sustainability of our planet, I suggest you look elsewhere for solutions.
Negative	Beware: Ordered retail, received knock-off: The whole point in ordering a genuine retail packaged Canon battery is to avoid cheap Chinese knockoffs. Unfortunately, I ordered two of this product and received just that. Make sure what you receive is a genuine Canon product in retail packaging with hologram. Even then, it's possible that the packaging + hologram has been spoofed.Needed these batteries for a trip to Africa, leaving tomorrow. Beware seller Savings 365
Positive	Hard to trust any other battery: I got an off-brand battery as an extra for my SD800 IS and was disapointed with the life. The Canon brand is worth the extra cost.
Positive	Perfect: I bought this to go with my SD700IS because I wanted to keep it all oem and just as the one that came with the camera I have to admit I have never seen a battery last longer I have had the camera for almost 4 months now and between the 2 batteries I have only charged both 1 time and believe me I use my camera allot!
Positive	Battery: great for when you need an extra battery. It is a great deal on amazon because the cost would be more at a retail store.
Positive	New battery in retail package: We wanted a spare camera battery for our Cannon SD870IS. It arrived on-time, and worked as expected. We no longer have to worry about our battery going dead on vacation and missing great pictures, we now have a spare.
Positive	Very Happy!: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Anyhow, the battery came in original and undamaged Canon packaging (looks just like the images available in product description). I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time. Our camera is fairly new so it was a fair comparison - one battery wasn't all that much older than the other.Email me with questions: mister_mr_d@hotmail.com
Positive	Canon Battery for Power Shot Camera: I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation.It has excellent reviews but battery life is one area where it's been criticized so I decided to purchase a backup before leaving. I decided against a generic battery after reading that although they're cheaper, they don't hold as good of a charge as a Canon. I purchased one from ANATOLIAN BOOKSTORE, INC. through Amazon because that was the best price I found and I was very pleased that the battery was indeed an authentic Canon and holds the same charge as the one that came with the camera.It was delivered promptly, at a good price and was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again.
Positive	"The battery that saved the wedding: With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"
Positive	"Choose Canon brand: I wanted a reliable second battery for my camera to take on an extended overseas vacation. I was concerned about ""OEM"" off-brands (which may be OK, but some reviewers advised caution). I was not disappointed by buying the Canon brand named battery which appears to function exactly as my original battery. The Amazon price was much better than I could find locally, and the delivery time was just a few short days after ordering."
Positive	"Fine battery: I purchased this as an extra battery for a Canon sd800is. It is the same as the original battery and is Canon ""branded"". A third party battery is available locally at TWICE the price, and the Canon version for almost three times the price. This is a good buy."
Negative	Canon NB-5L Battery Pack: The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products.
Positive	Must have...: If you are planing on taking that camera on vacation you need another battery and this thing is cheap enough to make the decision a no brainer!You know it is true! You will get to having SO MUCH FUN and forget that your camera has been working from sun up to sun down and now you have no photos of you and that special someone dancing at the cantina! You have no pictures of the lightshow, fireworks or anything else that happened after 9:34pm. The moment that your camera died!Charge both batteries, keep one in the case and one in the camera. Problem solved!
Positive	Cannon battery: Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
Positive	Canon MB-5L Battery Pack: I have a Canon Power Shot SX210IS. I called Canon to make sure this was the correct battery pack for it and they told me it was. I started to order it with Canon but it was much more expensive through them than through Amazon so I ordered it from Amazon instead. It came quickly and works wonderfully. I hadn't realized how much I missed taking digital photos that I could share online with friends and family in other states and areas.
Positive	Perfect backup battery: Although it doesn't get use unless we're out long enough to need a second battery, this product is working just like the original and seems to be a completely legit cannon production (despite a few other reviews).
Negative	"Not the original Canon battery: We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said ""new"". When looked closely at the battery, it's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera. I'm not sure if $29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery. We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description, or this is considered a deceiving."
Positive	Excellent little battery: I purchased this battery as a backup for a vacation. It works perfectly. It is indistinguishable from the battery that came with the camera, lasts just as long (one or two days of frequent use), and charges fairly quickly in the standard charger. For folks going on a trip, I recommend taking two batteries for your camera. Just slip the spare into your pocket (not with your loose change or car keys, though) and pop it in when the camera needs it. Charging took a few hours overnight. For European current, my standard charger (not incl) said it takes the local voltage, so I only needed a plug adapter.
Negative	"Knock off battery does not work at all: I ordered this battery, thinking that it was a 'real battery'. Did not charge or work at all - says ""Canon Made in China"". If this is not a manufacturer's battery then I paid way too much for it. Oh, since it doesn't work at all I paid way too much for it."
Negative	You get what you pay for: You get what you pay for. I have used these batteries as back up for the original Canon one. After 10 months with only occasional use, battery won''t take or hold a charge. Do you self a favor, and buy a Canon battery. You'll save money in the long run.
Negative	"Not working: I just got the ""New"" battery, but it looks like already got opened before.Also, It's not working. It can't charge the battery, the light is not turn on!!!!"
Positive	Canon NB-5L Battery for Canon camera: I purchased a Canon camera a couple of years ago and a Canon battery came with it. I bought a couple of generic brand batteries to use as backup. After a very short time, the generic brand batteries would only keep a charge for about ten minutes or less. Having learned my lesson, I purchased this additional Canon NB-5L battery for my backup. It holds a long charge and is very reliable. Don't waste your money on generic brands like I did, buy the name brand.
Positive	Brand Name Battery: A no-brainer! The best battery for your Canon camera. What else would Canon want in their cameras? DUH!
Negative	Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries.: After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned.
Negative	i have get my order: I never got the battery and im still waiting on it, I want to know whats going to happen cause im still waiting
Negative	Damaged: Was starting to swell, which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent
Positive	Ordered wrong Canon battery: I notified Digi Acc to let them know that I ordered the wrong battery. I have 2 Canon digitals and they use different batteries. I ordered the Canon NB-5L for the Canon SD950 IS and should have ordered the Canon NB-4L for the Canon ELPH100HS.I called Digi Acc and left them a message and never received a response. If someone would respond, I would like to exchange the battery.
Negative	Amazon mix-up: I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains.
Negative	Battery does not work with my Canon SD700: There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700. The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose. This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work, and I need to shake the camera, or remove the battery and insert it back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive. Made in China. Does not work. Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery?
Negative	NO, NO, and NO!: I only made it 15 minutes into this movie before I turned it off. My only question (and this pertains to plot, action sequences, dialogue, etc.) is WHY?
Negative	THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER! SEEN: I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
Negative	A Confusing Waste of Plastic: The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining.
Negative	OMG, a complete waste of time: Having read the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. It came & went big screen in near record time. That should have been warning enough. Unfortunately I rented this piece of **** and even worse, I watched the whole thing. All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited. And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD. I really wanted to give this zero stars, but that was not an option.
Negative	Why, oh why, oh why!: Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!
Negative	Avoid at all cost !!: Some movies are bad and worth watching 'cos they're bad, this one however is just a total stinker - no redeeming features whatsover. A total waste of time. Do not buy. Do not watch.
Negative	"Give me the original: I was surprised and delighted to see this ""remake"". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!"
Negative	Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.: The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague.
Negative	Don't expect much: The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!
Negative	Far Cry From Original: Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.
Negative	travesty remake on bluray? original not even on anamorphic dvd?: The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release.While the orignal classic rollerball hasn't even gotten an anamorphic dvd release, let alone a blu-ray!
Negative	Great movie, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old: The setting for this movie is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. The arena they skate in looks like a very cheap prop from American Gladiators. There is VERY LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS and no high tech equipment.15 minuets of the movie is done with a night vision camera, so everything you see is either dark green or picth black.Most of the action happens within the rollerball arena. There are only a few action sceens on the streets of the city.
Negative	"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,...: ""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes. It was terrible. The camera work was even altered when it came on video. I wouldn't have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn't! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
Negative	"What went wrong with this film?!: This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
Positive	NON-STOP ACTION...What's NOT to like about this movie?: I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
Negative	Horrible stupid movie: Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title.
Positive	GOOD drama, GREAT action!!!: Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
Negative	R?: What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!
Negative	Worst movie in a long time: This movie is pointless and stupid. The acting and camera work sucks. The story is sesame streetish and moronic. Stay very far away from this one.
Negative	Appalling: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
Negative	The Worst Movie Ever!: This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!
Negative	Rollerbomb: Stupid, vapid, anemic remake of the 1975 film. Buy the original instead.This film deserves zero stars.
Negative	Top Ten Worst Movies I ever Saw: This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown
Negative	"Pathetic: Rollerball in name only. While the original 1975 production was intelligent Science Fiction mixed with action and a touch of intrigue this sequel is nothing but garbage. To compare the two is like saying the first was a Rembrandt while this is urban scrawled graffiti.A great movie from 1975 dumbed down to suit the ethnically urbanized pseudo gangsters that make up the majority of todays youth sub culture. There's good reason that there are hundreds of this Rollerball movie being sold for a penny on Amazon and Ebay while the 1975 version still demands a fair price.Talk about living in a dystopic future society. With movies coming out that cater only to the sub culture niche of wanna be ""gangsta's"" and their hip hop mentality, it's becoming obvious that we ARE living in a dystopic society. This movie was trash."
Negative	Spectacularly bad: There is no plot. What in the world did I just watch? Nothing made sense, from beginning to end. I've lost my faith in humanity after watching this...
Negative	Proof that God does not exist: How could there be a God in a universe where the insidious Rollerball 2002 remake is available on blu-ray, but the original 1975 classic is not?
Negative	A Total Failure: If you've seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you'll probably want to give this remake a miss. It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive? Save your money and get a copy of the original Rollerball.
Negative	"Low-rent MTV fare...: This 2002 remake of an old classic ranks among other blockbuster flops like ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Waterworld."" It's the future and huge corporations control most of Earth. The one thing that keeps humanity together is Rollerball, a sport that is a mix of hockey, rollerblading, and pro wrestling. Paul Heyman is the announcer for Rollerball, proving that it is never a good thing to have a commentator with an annoying voice for your sport. Chris Klein is John, a young hot-shot who is learning fast that Rollerball is a tough ""sport."" He soon discovers that the corporations control everything that happens in the game. Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility. Even excellent actor Jean Reno does little in the way of making this movie even remotely interesting. It is a monotonous, unexciting flop, a plaigerized version of the fun James Caan film."
Negative	Little to say about this embarrassing film...: Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this.
Negative	BALLISTIC BOMB: This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals.
Negative	Horible: this movie, other than the scenes that depicted the actual game rollerball, was horifyingly (if thats a word) bad. do not see it! it is a huge waste of your moola.
Negative	Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do: This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it.
Negative	The pits: A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous.
Negative	Waste of celluloid: It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with.
Positive	The Last Word: Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie. The characters, well acted and their stories get under one's skin. A must see.
Positive	Not Bad At All.....: This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time. Nothing unusual about the story. Just light, breezy read on a Sunday afternoon.And both lead characters were likeable. Something that's harder and harder to find in the genre, IMHO.
Negative	uggh!: I ordered this border for my new twins nursery! It is truly a cute colorful boarder. I was so excited to find it a a great price! Now i know why!I had one whole roll on the wall and neither of the other 2 rolls would match up to the one i already had on the wall! The borders were different widths! Which throws off all the lines on the border!I even checked the lot numbers on the packaging and they all matched? I had to get very creative to make it work since I already had a whole roll on the wall! very frustrating!
Positive	Buying another one!: I bought the original 4 years ago, have loved it, and am buying the remanufactured one for our vacation home. I expect it (after reading all the other reviews) to perform exactly like my original, which is still performing beautifully. Looks great on the kitchen counter, too--very classy.
Negative	Design confuses some into burning kettle: I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).
Positive	Just Like New: Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.
Positive	So far so good: This is our 2nd electric kettle. We had a Breville & it stopped workingafter about 2 years of use. The Cuisinart came looking brand new. So farit has been working just fine & for the price I figured it was worth a shot.We have been happy with it and it gets used at least 2 times a day.
Positive	Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook: A useful tool: Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this book is quite useful. Field personnel, command staff, and planners - all will find it helpful. I found it to be concise, packable, and physically handy. About the only thing I'd change would be to laminate the pages for weather resistance.R.D. Lopez, Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Specialist, Dept. of Public Health
Positive	Needed for class: Not too much to say; it is the book I needed for class and I got it at a good price on Amazon.
Positive	A picture book with great photos and interesting historical: This picture book has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. The pages are spread by the breaks in text that we know from reciting the pledge orally at school. Children are from different races. Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given. Facts about the American flag's changes over the years and facts about the proper way to display a flag, and on what days, are included.A beautiful book with great information that every child should be exposed to.
Positive	Good pictures: This has god pictures and background info on flag. The pledge is written on the pages as you go through the book.
Positive	criminally under rated doom metal!: these guys were the cream of the doom metal crop late 80s/early 90s.melodically heavy and great musicanship they are very black sabbath insired and can definetly pick up the pace and move.thi live cd is recorded very well and candlemass was in rare form for these recording.get a piece of history buy this cd.
Negative	This is awful: I bought this album because it had some songs off of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus on it but it was a complete dissappointment, it has the really horrible singer that sounds nothing like the original singer, and he completely destroys some of my favorite songs with his awful warbling and squalking.
Positive	Pretty Good: After taking a long break from rapping, LL Cool J seems to hold his own on this one, with pretty good production and talented guests, this one is sure to go platinum. Congratulationz to LL Cool j, I thought you fell off, you proved me wrong!
Positive	"THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME: Everyone should buy this album.It's the best album he ever recorded.The album is a must have cd for all true LL fans.All the tracks are slamin from start to finish.Like the title say ""Greatest Of All Time""."
Positive	"ill joint!!!!: When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it....all I can say is that its tight. You gotta check out joints like ""Imagine That"", ""Take It Off"" and ""Fuhgidabowdit"". Other ill joints are ""Farmers"" and ""Hello"" what the heck every song is fresh. This is way better than his previous joint ""Phenomenon"". Get this one, it sure is butta...its great to see the one of tha greatest back in tha game!!!!"
Negative	"Disappointed: I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like ""see-through"" clear blue plastic. Unfortunately, it looks like its made from some sort of tubberware material.The electronic sounds (2 and not in any sequence),one sounds okay/good, the other sounds like the flushing sound on my daughters potty book. The eyes look like round paper decals and looks...wierd. I'm sure my 6 yr old son would like it, just because its YU-GI-OH, but I'm a fan too and was excited about getting this for him for XMAS......I'm glad I started early, I can return it for something else."
Positive	awsome new blue-eyes shining dragon figure: this is a large blue eyes shining dragon figure from the Yu-Gi-Oh movie! this is the coolest toy. you can have the blue eyes shining dragon in attack mode or in flight mode. it also shoots a blue missle. it isnt very educational, but it is a lot of fun. it is very durable and well worth the money.
Positive	"WORTH THE MONEY!!!!: My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh. He can't wait to receive this for Christmas. $30.00 does seem like a lot of money for this, but the plain Yu-Gi-Oh figures are $20.00 a pack. Besides, this is the ""cool dragon"" (as my son calls it) from the movie so it is worth it to see him get so exited when he opens this. Note: I was in a Toys R Us store today and these same dragons were priced on clearance at $14.99."
Positive	Blue Eyes Shining Dragon: I do own this toy, and is a huge fan of the film, so this toy for me is very nice. It may not be very durable, or does much, or may not look like the reall thing very much, but that is why you can still pretend with it. The toy itself lights up and makes noises. Also, when you press a button on its back, its wings and legs spread out, so like the Duel Disk Launcher, it could hurt a real little kid, but not kids who know what it does. I still have fun with the toy, plus it doubles as a model for those out there who like the model Yu-Gi-Oh! products. Although not one of the greatest toys to role of the line, but still nice to play with.
Positive	Favorite toy at birthday party: Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is one of my childs favorite toys, it is large and movable with lights and sounds. It also shoots a spear like thing from its mouth. The toy is very durable and not too loud. My son can play with it for hours. It definitely made his birthday special - well worth the money!
Negative	COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!: I simply cannot believe that I paid $30 bucks for this thing. It does absolutely NOTHING, except make a few electronic noises. I kept poring over the instructions, certain that I'd missed something......but I hadn't!! BORING. I think that even my 7-year-old son, who wanted this thing, was disappointed. And don't even talk about the batteries...to add insult to injury, this thing takes button cells, which aren't cheap. Save your $$ for something better.DYB
Negative	One of my favorite toys!: This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
Negative	"So much potential, but one overwhelming problem: On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit ""to make some sound"" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder."
Negative	This machine makes as much noise as a power tool: All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......
Positive	This is an answer to the TV Guide issue: I have the Philips HDRW720 and had identical TV Guide issues. I talked to the Philips people and the TV Guide people. It seems that the problem is with the cable companies. My company is Brighthouse (Time Warner) and they had compatability problems with the TV Guide program as recently as September 2005 here in Florida. At time there would be no data or missing data. I tried to record programs but there would be nothing because the cable company was not transmtting the data. It has improved 100% since I bought my recorder, still not perfect but almost there.
Negative	Engineering gone bad: I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS.It's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. They last about 2 months(or less), after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own. My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it. The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit cannot even be purchased on -line at any web site anymore. This is sad after only a few months on the market. I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer.
Negative	"A Note about Charles Taze Russell: It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
Negative	Please review the sited URL.: [...]I would not recommend this book. Russell does make some remarkable findings, however, his theology is corrupt and he is a party to a cult.
Positive	Foie Gras: As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras. It is not as good as the product we purchased in Paris and brought back with us in January, but it was all I could find that was affordable. Store in Refrigerator and note the long shelf life. Very tasty.
Negative	I used to eat it till I found out how it was made: diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy.
Negative	Who eats Fois Gras?: So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding.
Positive	Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans: This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
Positive	What a book!!: I am using this textbook in a class and it is a whopper. Wonderful pictures, easy to read, clear colors and understandable. I've been working in prisons for 5 years and this book makes a lot of sense. You ought to read their sections on women in prison and on probation. I loved the parts on geriatric prisoners (old cons) and the death penalty. And it is easy to read. More!
Positive	Long time quilter: I really liked some of the simple quilts in this book. A change from some of the challenging patterns. Brings you back to your roots. Thimnbleberries has always been one of my favorites.
Positive	You Don't Need a Math Degree to Understand this: Chaos is such a visually stunning field of study, since you invariably run into those computer generated figures of Julia sets or random fractal landscapes or cloud formations.But can we get a rigorous, first principles explanation that is broadly accessible to undergraduates with good, but not advanced math preparation? Well, you might consider this recent book. The authors have gone to some length to explain events without appealing to more than simple calculus.Nothing flashy. But you can obtain a good understanding of fractal dimensions, self iterating systems (like a Sierpinski gasket) and noise.
Positive	Very good movie about medical students: Very well taken movie that depicts the sacrifices and passion required for medical profession. Background score goes very well with the movie.
Positive	"VHS tape of Vital signs: Fun movie, but the tape quality listed as ""NEW"" has faded colors- VHS tapes just don't hold up. Arrived on time and otherwise in excllent condition"
Positive	89 chevy s10 single cab: i wanted to know if this will fit my 1989 chevy s10 single cab regular bed please let me know as soon as possible so i can place my order
Positive	God's Dawn for Every Darkness: This is a wonderful, encouraging, faith inspiring book. Well written, concise. Thought provoking, inspirational, devotional. Very good to read on the run or to meditate on. Highly recommended. I have it and am giving it as gifts@
Negative	Cheap. OK value for $9, but not a cent more.: Poor quality fabric, not soft like flannel should be. But was only $9 and it's for my guest bed, so I guess it's OK.
Negative	DISAPPOINTED: I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
Negative	i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!: I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices
Negative	Disappointed except for price: I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!
Negative	Elastic is falling out of the fitted sheets.: I bought 3 sheet sets, I have noticed on the two queen size sheets that the stitching that holds the elastic in has come apart in several places and the elastic is now falling out. I have only washed these sets two times. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
Negative	HOW DISAPPOINTING: That is all I can say - you get what you pay for is clearly underrated - you buy sheets for under 10 dollars - what on earth was I thinking - well, I got paper thin sheets that I hope make it thru the first washing -will use them as emergency sheets for guests that want a place to crash - will provide toilet seat cover-like protection against the mattress and who knows what it will feel like next to the skin!! Warning - Caveat Emptor!
Positive	Good for the price: I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. These are not the best but they certainly are good enough. They are a bit thin but soft and warm. I do recommend them.
Negative	"Shrinkage: These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
Negative	Great Price, But......: I ordered these sheets hoping for that comfy flannel sheet I remembered from the old days. Snuggling under the covers in the Fall and Winter, cosseted by soft sheets. Perhaps, I was too optimistic, given the price.These sheets seem to be fairly good quality, but they don't have that fuzzy softness of flannel. There's really not much nap. They are made of a low thread count sort of jersey fabric. The patterns are good, and they come packaged nicely, but in an era where high thread count sheets are available affordably, these sheets are a disappointment.If you like jersey-type sheets, and you aren't too concerned about the softness right out of the package or the thread count, these could be just right for you. And you can't beat the price.
Negative	Seamingly poor quality: The pillow case seam tore wide open after initial washing (before I even used the set!). I stitched back up and the rest of the set seems fine. Could just be an anomoly, but beware. But then again, they were only $20.
Positive	Cozy - great price: Very deep pockets, so fits a bit loosely on a standard twin, but it's soft and cozy. I actually look forward to sleeping with these sheets! Discounted price is GREAT!
Negative	Wrong sheets: I don't know if I'm the only one that experienced this problem but I ordered the BLUE FLORAL Paisley set and got some ugly checkered blue design. Looks like a little kids room sheet. I emailed Amazon and they resend another sheet set that looks EXACTLY the same as the wrong one I received before! I'm giving the item poor ratings because Amazon gives you something that's not even shown on the screen (nor in any of the other options that are even sold out). I'm not even sure what they're shipping out, but it's not what's described on the page. If you have this problem, please email Amazon, so I'm not the only one with this complaint. Thanks.
Negative	You get what you pay for, and we didn't pay much :-(: The fit of the fitted sheet is LOUSY - the first night we had it on the mattress, it came off. I guess Amazon sold them cheap to get rid of them.DO NOT BUY THESE!!
Negative	unusable, avoid it: After 1st wash, even before 1st use. It became unusable: full of tiny cotton balls on the surface; shrank 20% at least; tended break. Note that I did follow the wash direction.Now I have to cut them into pieces and see if they are any good for wiping dirt off my car. It not even worth the return postage.
Negative	bad: got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money
Negative	Not really a bargain--terrible sheets: Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white.
Negative	These sheets will self-destruct...: The hems on the flat sheet became unraveled after the very first wash, not just in a few places, but the full length on both sides! However the fabric is soft to the touch and the price was insanely low, so I gave it a courtesy second star.
Negative	poor workmanship!: These sheets looked pretty until they fell apart the first time I washed them. How does a sheet fall apart? Well, in this case the raw edges were left exposed in several areas when the hems were put in. The exposed fabric, which is loosely woven to start with, simply unraveled. If you must get these sheets, I suggest you have your sewing machine ready to re-sew all seams and hems before using or washing them.
Negative	Flannel Sheets -- Not Recommended: Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4.99, I would not recommend these flannel sheets for purchase because of the very poor sewing workmanship. The stitches were very large, and also some of the edges were simply turned over once and sewn with a raw (easy to unravel) edge. The sheet would not hold up well after the first washing. I resewed all the edges of both sheets.
Positive	"Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap.: The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at ""Dollar General"". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift."
Positive	My wife loves them!: Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale.
Positive	One of my all-time favorites: This movie is not for everyone, but I love the absurd humor. Every character in it is irrational in some way. Where films today would probably mock the characters in a mean way, this film has more of a sad and sweet acceptance of their eccentricities. It respects the courage of human beings who have obviously been damaged by the hardships of life but still continue to muddle through. Just like real life.
Negative	Another Warners Archive Collection Bust: As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection. Here is the statement from this website concerning this title:Important Note: This film has been manufactured from the best-quality video master currently available and has not been remastered or restored specifically for this DVD and Digital Download release. Click here to preview this film's video quality.Had I realized this fact, I would not have purchased this DVD from Amazon.
Positive	great toy: the toy is pretty awsome. it is a lot of fun and really cool. the only problem is that the batteries die really fast.
Negative	JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. he wanted it so much we tried returning it twice after the third one didn't work even my six year old said forget it. I wish i could have given it a black hole instead of 1 star. JUNK!!!!!!!!
Positive	coooooooooooooooooool: this toy looks really cool, but i think they should make it have better graphics and a better screen.
Positive	Help!In major confusion, WHAT TO BUY???!!!: Please i can't decide. I have NEVER seen, played, or touched an Advanced Pet. At toywiz.com com, they have all the pets you would want. Pet1 ,Pet2 ,progress pet.wHAT TO BUY! I read everything i can to find out. I have $91. I could buy almost all of them. But... which one to buy?! this one sounds okay. I never heard anything about the progress pet. But it sounds so good. So if you are willing to help me, post it on the next review. Then i will decide out of all three, which is the best, and until i find out, i will tell all megaman fans, about the best p.e.t.!!
Negative	This toy is the WORST!: This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't.
Negative	"The batteries died after less than one day!: I bought a couple of these for my sons. They love to play with them, but after only a few hours of use, the batteries are dead! This could get really expensive considering the batteries are about $3 each. Also, one thing that gets very irritating is the shaking of the PET that has to be done when you get a ""virus"". Very annoying!"
Negative	Expensive Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Our 8 year old son ACHED for this toy for his birthday and although we thought it to be expensive junk, we wanted to see him happy. The FIRST one we returned thinking it was broken but soon realized with the SECOND one that we just weren't shaking it hard or long enough. After a week of trying to figure this thing out, the screen has gone fuzzy and even a new battery could not revive it. Even our 8 year old is disgusted and frustrated with the quality of this toy. It is going back tomorrow - at our son's request. If your little boy wants this toy, please show him this review and suggest he pick something else. It's just an expensive disappointment. Please read the review by Diane. She says it so much better than we ever could.
Positive	bought 2 and am happy: Here's a tip - don't shake it up and down. Turn the unit upside down so that the back of the unit is facing the ceiling and shake it side to side. My older son (7) uses that method and he can get it to recover quickly and find viruses as easy as pie. I actually took this sucker apart - the motion detection unit is actually a small metal marble that rolls over a circuit board contact - be careful taking it apart tho - its would be easy to lose the marble and then it would never work.The battery has also lasted for us 2 weeks under fairly strong use - he's up to level 16. My yonger son (5) also has one and while he's not as enthralled - no problems.
Positive	The Cool Gizmo: I think the megaman PET is really cool. It is really cool that I can have my very own NetNavi like Lan and Chaud on the Megaman TV show. I get to fight viruses like Lan and enter tournaments once you bet 10 viruses.Then you can battle against rival NetNavis and use battlechips.I also like the fact that you can battle against your friends. The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away. Overall I think the PET is very cool.
Negative	I hate useless products: You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun.
Negative	Too complicated: The children were happy to play with it but since the electronics was so poor they were very dissappointed and left it on the table
Negative	junk junk junk: it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white.also it moves very slow on the screen.that is what little of a screen it has.(...)i say get av gameboygame instead.at least that has decent graphics and isn,t a cheap piece of plastic.overall it is a piece of junk.
Positive	MY SOON TO BE NEW TOY: I Cant wait till christmas then i will get my advace pet i seen what it could do so i cant wait.hey does it come with a jack in cord so u could like jack in to ur computer and add stuff.If so that joint is cool right protoman (yep)!!! hheehehehe im 14 years old and i approve this toy to be the best.
Negative	peice of garbage!!: Okay this game was pretty fun when I first bought it but after that it just wasnt fun anymore. the thing has no plot but fight viruses and enter tournaments which are VERY hard. Plus there is quite a bit of shaking for an electronic game.
Negative	Didn't perform as expected: It doesn't cooperate and isn't very user friendly. It feels like it takes forever of shaking until it finally finds a virus for you to fight. Very annoying...especially when mom is fussing at me to stop shaking it.
Positive	People...: The Plug-In PET is not coming to America. The season of NT Warrior is already over, Axess is airing now. They would have brought the Plug-In to America before the Adanced PET. It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all...
Positive	COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS TOY IS THE BOMB!this toy has the looks, graphics,& the talents!!!even though i have not played it,i think this toy is very,very,very,cool!when i get my PET,i will go bananas!3 questions:1.how many battle chips can you use at one time?2.can you jack in to any thing?3.where can you get battle chips?THATS ALL FOLKS!
Positive	An Easy Way To Play: Hi i got this game by trading my brother for some stuff he wanted and i started playing it and was disipointed cause you have to shake it so much. But luckily i figured out how you can get in battles and stuff without having to shake it at all. But it depends on if you you have a massage chair or not because if you have one you can set your magaman pet on it and it shakes it!!! I was so glad when i figured out how to get in battles without shaking it because my arm was hurting now i find the game real fun. I hope this review helped you see yah.
Positive	So human, so hot: Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more, the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain, their joy, their search, their honesty, the lies, the hopes, the hot , out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears, and compassion, and much, much more. Hot, hot, hot.
Positive	Very sexy: I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him.
Positive	Nice for uniforms: They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big. I haven't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him.
Positive	material is great: love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product
Positive	Great product: Looks and fits great! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform. He loves them....
Positive	excellent lyrics: If your looking for music that is true to life and chills u out on a sunny sfternoon then buy this cd...beautiful voice!
Positive	"mayhem are the gods of black metal!: yeah,...this isn't as great as ""mysteriis"",but who cares,...brutal as a really brutal thing,.. buy it,you won't be disanpointed,...hellhammer,maniac,blasphemer and necro putcher,...do i need to say more?"
Positive	"Mayhem Lives!: This may be my favourite Mayhem album of all. As opposed to the crude ""deathcrushing"" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of ""De Mysteriis,"" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before. Usually very fast, sometimes atmospheric (all done w/out synths, except for the ambient intro track), and always hellish - every aspect of this music is absolutely insane, and it definitely gives hope for a grim future."
Positive	"Savage and brutal: This is a great, great cd. As the first Mayhem release with the current lineup, they came right out of the box with a masterpiece of unanticipated power. Each track is just monstrous in every way; and the production is some of the very best you'll likely ever hear on a black metal release. Note that this contains the first part of their epic full- length release ""Grand Declaration Of War"", so be sure to buy both. You won't be disappointed if raw, seriously dangerous metal is what you're looking for."
Positive	The cliches were invented right here: There are Hammett fans and Chandler fans. I am for Hammett, but Chandler's work remains compelling. The plots are nonsense but the metaphors are the purest gold. The opening scenes of THE BIG SLEEP and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY are delicious every time.
Positive	Great Stuff: Second only to Dashiell Hammett, the works of Raymond Chandler are the best in American crime fiction. Great style with words, intrieging plots, fascinating characters, I enjoy everthing he has written. The Big Sleep is also a wonderful movie with Bogie playing the lead and Bacall the vamp.
Positive	Pour the scotch and smoke 'em if you've got 'em: What I consider one of the greatest descriptive writers in the Western cannon, Chandler can transport you in to old Los Angeles. Every story will make you crave a stiff drink and perhaps even leaving a smell of tabacoo in your clothes. I recomend these stories to people who want to understand LA better because Chandler caught the essence of the city that can even be seen today. Look down the 2nd street tunnel at 2 am and see that barrel of a gun or drive to the Rosebowl and see why he makes reference that there are no sidewalks in that wealthy neighborhood. If you want to learn about noir, there is a reason Chandler is considered one of the fathers.
Positive	"Chandler joins the ranks of America's elite authors: The addition of this title and its companion volume, ""Later Novels & Other Writings,"" to the venerable Library of America series makes official what mystery fans have always known: Raymond Chandler is one of the gods of American literature. Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for ""Double Indemnity,"" and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life. In terms of literary inventions, the Wild West cowboy and the hard-boiled PI are this country's only true native sons, and, as such, are deserving of resepct. One of them at least now has it.--Michael Roger"
Negative	"Pathetic: I bought this album because I heard a killer version of ""White Christmas"" on a station on Live365. The link pointed me to this album. What a dissapointment! The tracks are half-baked, synth-drenched remakes with none of the swing of the song I heard. Liner notes are non-existant, leading me to wonder if any of the original Drifters even had a hand in this project. Don't waste your money! I did manage to locate the version I heard on Rhapsody on an album called ""Soul Christmas"" on Atlantic Records."
Positive	great!: got this one for my girlfriend, she really likes it a lot so im happy, sometimes sounds a lot like king diamond haha but what can i say it sounds good!
Negative	Not appropriate for 9 yr olds: My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
Negative	wrong trikke in box: I purchased this Trikke thinking that it would be a great surprise for my son on his birthday. When I received the Trikke it was missing two pieces. This Trikke came in a box that didnt match the product. It does not fold down at all which makes it hard to pack for trips etc... I am very dissappointed in this product and Razor company should get a great big slap for false advertising. The advertisment also does not state the weight capacity, its say both kids and adults can enjoy this product. The weight capacity is only 175lbs. It does not come with an owners manual, and there is no tool case. The allen wrenches come in a plastic baggie taped with scotch tape. Very Very disappointed.
Negative	not as advertised: the item description says this is aluminum, but when i received the item, the box says 'solid steel'. very dissappointing! i live by the beach and steel doesn't last long. it was for my son's birthday, now i have to send it back and he won't have his main present!
Negative	Not what we thought: From pictures, etc., we thought this trike somehow had a means of locomotion - swaying back and forth? My determined child never figured it out, and instructions never hinted to a technique. So, it ends up being a scooter that is not very functional because it's hard to balance on one side and scoot with the other foot.
Positive	"Classic Soundtracks at their Best!: This disc is simply gorgeous! I love classic movie scores, and this is one of my favorite collections. The ""Gunga Din"" and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" themes are so well done you can imagine each scene from the movie as it is played. These are my two favorite scores in the collection because the various themes are each given their own track. (And I already had the other scores on another compilation!) It really is a must for classic movie lovers!!!!!"
Positive	One of my favorites...: Mr. Pratchett is a very good writer, and while not every discworld novel is a knock out, none have been bad. Of all of his work this is my favorite. I reread it at least every couple of months. Bruthra and Om [pointy horns] spin a tale quite entertaining that keeps me coming back. I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do.
Positive	"Not at all what you'd expect from fantasy, but...: still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a ""British"" or an ""American"" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."
Positive	The turtle moves!: My sister read this book aloud to me on a road trip from Seattle to California. It is a work of multilayered artistry to be appreciated from the spiritual to the fantastic. It's also fun and unlike most of Pratchett's books you actually care about most of the characters. Reads well out loud as well. Like many readers here, I see it as the author's pinnacle, the book that he will be remembered for. Here's to immortality, Mr. Pratchett!
Positive	Good fun, as usual: A really fun book, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. None of our old pals [Rincewind, Gaspode, Vimes, Susan] put in an appearence [other than the guy WHO TALKS LIKE THIS and an old monk with a broom, and they but briefly], but it does add some info to the overall Discworld mythology, and provides some laughs as well.
Positive	Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or ....: I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read.
Negative	"Not Prachett's best by a long shot.: Terry Pratchett's other books are a lot like well painted homes. There are several layers. ""Small Gods"" is like inviting over your friends to paint. There is one uneven coat of paint and they left masking tape on all of the edging in an unsuccessful attempt to miss it with their paintbrushes. The ending of the book (and middle and beginning too if truth be known) left me with the same vague feeling of dissatisfaction as when I realized that to get the place properly painted I would have to have another seperate group of friends and throw another 'paint party'."
Positive	MIGHTY ENDING: I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun.
Positive	Great: Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny. I particulary liked the philosophers. But the greatest character had to be Om.
Positive	"""To not read this is a sin."" Toni VII, verse 4: Whoever read the first page of the book and like the stile of the exposition there must buy the book.There is nothing greater under the sun and on the Disk as well then that. (I can fill that my Gods are suffering because, I'm begining to belive in the book instead of them) But what can I do - it's stronger then me.What can I say (take a look on my e-mail address) It says it all."
Positive	"The most hilarious in-depth look at religion around!: Like all other Pratchett novels, this one is extremely witty, sarcastic, and equally intelligent. Let's start a new religion- we'll call it ""Pratchettism"""
Positive	"An interesting book: This is the thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld--a flat world, supported on the back of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle, anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.Brutha is a novice in the temple of Om, and he thought that things were very settled. And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (""Psst!"") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"
Positive	I'm a Terry Pratchett's fan: Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it. Makes you think about faith while it makes you laugh about everything. If I had not read better Pratchett's books, I would have rated this with a five
Positive	Now consider the tortoise and the eagle.....: This was one of the best books in the discworld series i ever read. The Great God Om, wanting to stir up the belief of his followers, decides to manifest himself. He has taken the form of very majestic creatures in the past but for some reason that even he cannot understand he has now manifested himself as a two pound tortise and cannot even do proper miricles anymore. Finding himself with only one true believer (the others trusting in the Quisition)he must try to find a way, using this beliver as his prophet, to regain proper godship. This will be no easy task because the only person that believes in him is not even a preist and tends a small vegetable garden...
Positive	A Philosophy Book Encapsulated in Discworld: I've been reading the Discworld books in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!
Positive	Hilarious: The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing.
Positive	A must-read for whoever enjoys zany stories and good laughs!: Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods. Brutha, a lowly, simple-minded novitiate of a mighty religious empire, has just met his god face-to-face. Actually, heel-to-face, because the mighty god Om is really a not-so-mighty tortoise who is out to reclaim his empire -- with Brutha's help
Positive	A+: the book came really fast and was in great condition, I cant wait to read it i would order from them again for sure.
Negative	Missing pages in ebook: I'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he's created and the incredibly intelligent books. While I greatly enjoy the book itself, I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone. Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return. Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal. There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version.
Positive	Chelonian Theology: Nobody can discuss serious philosophical issues in hysterically funny ways like Terry Pratchett. Small gods is as intelligent exploration of theology and people's relationship to religion as you'll find but if that's not what you want to take from it you'll have a great time laughing through the book. The Turtle Moves.
Positive	moking religeon! , I like it.: this book should be worshiped as the bilble so that I dont have to go to church. the reason this book was so funny is becouse jokes are funnier writen down.
Negative	Finally, a let down: I have read most of this series with great delight. However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel.
Negative	"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation: While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."
Negative	simply not that funny: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)
Negative	a disgrace to religion: although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett.
Negative	Zzzz...: In my opinion, the worst book in the series. I read this book through just because I did not want to waste my spent money.do only buy it if you are a HARDCORE Discworld Fan.
Positive	Helpful: I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.
Positive	Grandma loves it: We have some native roots and my grandmother found this book fascinating. I bought her several Iroquois books from Amazon as a Christmas gift and she loved them all. She keeps calling me to tell me about them.
Positive	Shakespeare criticism - a historical survey and sampler: Halliday's excellent introduction makes a historical survey of Shakespeare criticism . Halliday claims that new perceptions of Shakespeare were developed at fifty year intervals starting with his his contemporaries, then with Dryden in the Restoration, Pope in the Augustan Age, Johnson in the Age of Reason, and Coleridge in the Romantic Age. One of the surprising revelations is that it is only with Coleridge that Shakespeare is written and thought about primarily as a poet. It is Coleridge who too lays waste the conception that Shakespeare was a wild , careless genius with little concern for the artistic construction of his work.The second part of the work contains brief selections of criticisms about the individual plays.I found this work provides a sense of the overall development of Shakespeare criticism from its inception to the mid- twentieth century.A valuable work.
Negative	The worst mess ever: DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!
Negative	"Awful, at best: Wow, this is one of the most useless ""books"" I have ever read. Based on the title, one would expect some sort of insight into a career search. I found this book to be no help at all. It looks like the author lifted a few job ideas from the government job handbook and wrote a bad Clif's Notes for them. If you want guidance, please do not waste your time and money on this drivel. I agree with the previous reviewer.... I feel sorry for anyone that actually paid for this book."
Negative	Spend your money better: This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.
Negative	Measurements????: Since I can't get Babies R Us to write me back, I thought I'd try this. What are the measurements of this valance? Length? Width? Anyone who can offer this information would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!
Positive	This movie is Funny: I really liked the part when John Candy was at the firing range. This movie is one of Candy's greatest.
Negative	AWFUL!: A really horrible movie! Not funny. Poorly made. Much of it was incomprehensible. Production quality was poor. Video manufacturing quality is poor. AVOID THIS CLUNKER!!!
Negative	Incredibly bad: Even for someone who likes bad movies and can sit through most troma films, this movie is too terrible to watch. Despite numerous attempts, I've never managed to sit through it once.
Negative	tbone: thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
Positive	"the best of anastacia: this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. how this woman is not as successful in the usa as she is in europe is beyond me. so many great songs here. from the dance/pop/r+b of her first two albums, to the rock influenced hits from her third album. this is a great way to catch up if you've missed out on anastacia.also includes ""everything burns"" with ben moody from evanesence and her gorgeous duet with italian superstar eros romazotti, ""i belong to you"""
Positive	Anastasia Rocks: The CD is great. Every song has its own personality and that makes the entire CD very diverse. I especially love the mixes on the second disc.
Positive	FABULOUS! A MUST FOR ANASTACIA FANS!: FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS!! This CD has all the songs I love from miss Anastacia. She is so fantastic and deserves more recognition in the US. SPROCK ON ANA!!any USA Anastacia fans please contact me at Anastacia.The_Voice@yahoo.com
Negative	Fanatical: My nutritionist (who is a celiac) asked me to burn this book! The advice is fanatical. Throw away your non-stick cookware, plastic containers and wooden spoons because they are contaminated. Pleassse!
Negative	The Gluten-Free Bible: There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer.
Negative	Great attitude, if only the info was great...: Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free.
Negative	Do not hear, do not obey...: If you have a mild to moderate gluten intolerance, you can MAYBE follow this book's advice and be safe. If you have full on Celiac Disease, you will find yourself sick in a single digestive cycle!Jax's information is lacking, out of date, and incorrect. I obsessively research foods, medicines, ingredients, and restraunts so as to be able to join my friends and family in their dinners, and my research shows Jax to be woefully incorrect. I'm encouraging my local booksellers to not carry this any more, and I encourage the discerning readers amoung you to take great care. If you want the feel good stories, read the feel good stores. Don't take the feel bad advice.
Negative	"Irresponsible!: What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"
Negative	Socialite celiac: Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out. It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children. She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated.I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life.
Negative	Poor Information for Celiacs: I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
Negative	new celiacs need to read with caution: While there is much good information and insightful stories in this book, there is also some information that is just inaccurate and/or very disputed within the celiac community. If you are a newly diagnosed celiac, please read this book with caution and refer to other sources. Danna Korn's books (Wheat-free, Worry-free and Kids with Celiac) are very factual and well researched. Tania Pineo
Positive	A must read for barn lovers....: I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book.
Positive	"cuts to the heart: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, ""Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)"" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an ""easy"" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as ""electric""--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten."
Positive	magic under a microscope: After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing.
Positive	Quality Product: Pro - Product is of the highest quality. Con - I'm looking for rivets to fit this unit and can't find them!! Amazon do not carry them.
Negative	missing pieces, no response from company: I needed this for a small repair job , but thought it would be useful to have around for years to come. I ended up returning it because parts were missing and the company never responded when i contacted them on their website.A note in the box requested that issues be resolved by contacting the company rather than returning the item, which I tried to follow, but when they don't respond to contact through their website, what is one to do but send the tool back?you can use this tool to repair your broken canondale road shifter bosses (on the downtube). just replace the easily broken bar with a slightly larger hole and a couple of m5 rivnuts and you're good to go. you can also easily install water bottle cages to any sheet of metal you can drill a pair of holes in.
Negative	Veclo stap to large: I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe. My son looks like he is wearing orthopedic shoes, I had to return them he just looked way to goofy
Positive	POID review: The book was new and in perfect condition. The price was well below that of many competitors. It was sent in a timely manner. I would gladly buy from this company again.
Negative	On second thought: I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine.
Positive	David: In this unique conbination of biography, commentary, & devotional, Arthur Pink offers an intimate view of the many sides of David. The shepherd, the soldier, the king and the sinner are revealed in a way that cuts to the heart of life's greatest problems.
Positive	Fantastic. Up close and personal. Scripturally accurate.: Doesn't get much better than this. What a blessing I have recieved from Pink's expositional approach to this great King's life.
Negative	Beyond Poor ! Poor, Poor ,Poor, Poor !: When I ordered the book it was listed as ( like new ) Hog Wash ! the inside of the book was high lighted with yellow lighter and ink pen from beginning to end , there is hardly one page that is not completely marked up. What the heck ? I bought the book for a gift ( one the best book on the planet by the way ) the book is an heirloom, I was very disappointed , the delivery time was good, but the condition of the book is just crap. For me there is no way to correct this at this point, I needed it by this coming Friday... absolute disappointment !Dan Hall
Positive	"Stunning!: Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their ""rehearsals"" at the Cultural Center in Rio. Beautifully filmed and edited (except for some frontal shots of Zelia where the camera seems to shake), this DVD was recorded one years after the CD of the same name. It's fascinating to hear how the songs evolved after a year of working together. So many highlights, I can't even begin...but will simply mention that Zelia is in top form and wearing a beautiful dress!Just check it out--you'll be glad you did! Maravilhosa!!!Beleza, Zelia!!!!!"
Positive	Zelia Duncan: This is an excellent DVD. The music is fantastic, the singer is great and the musicians are the best. I highly recommend it!
Negative	Where's the instructions: Was a little tricky without instructions but I figured it out....however, will not work on the bike as the brackets are too thick to slide over the wheel bolts and leave enough room for the frame to be reattached. Returning it
Positive	Bike Basket: Good quality overall. The braket for the stem didn't fit my application, so I improvised, and mounted it behind the seat over the rear fender and low. Holds stuff.
Positive	Behind the Eyes: A darker side of Amy. Probably written and recorded when her marriage was falling apart. Very insiteful.
Positive	Behind the Eyes Amy Grant: Hello, this CD has some good songs on it too. I like she sounds on this one. It has some happy songs on it.
Positive	One of Amy's best pop albums...: This is a sad and thoughtful album, indeed, and Amy writes one of the saddest songs on this album (Missing you). Many of the songs are about unrequited love, marriage, and hardships in life. This album def. reflects Amy's feelings on her marriage to Gary Chapman, and her love for Vince Gill. It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer. Buy it if you like Amy's previous pop albums, or if you like sad songs (Which I do!)Choice tracks:Nobody homeCry a river,Leave it all behind,Missing you,The feeling that I had,Somewhere down the road.
Positive	"Refreshing new material by Amy Grant: Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy's two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. ""Turn This World Around"" is my favorite on the CD, but the rest of the material is also great."
Positive	Odd that this is my favorite...so you know it has to be good: I'll keep it short since I want to go eat my lunch. Out of the hundreds (at least) of CDs I've listened to, this is my favorite of ALL TIME. Which is weird, because I don't have any other Amy Grant albums, and I'm actually not interested in any other albums by her. So you know there has to be something great about it. I heard this album, and promptly went out to buy it. I went on a cross-country train trip by myself last summer, and this CD was a great one to have while I looked out at America flying past my window and thought about life. I don't mean to sound dramatic or over-the-top, but this CD affects me in a way that VERY few other albums do. It trancends the normal music world.
Positive	"Great CD!: I think that this is a great album. My personal favorite song on it is ""Like I Love You."" Probably the most popular song on it is ""Takes a little time."" My friend is crazy about that song! You should buy this CD!"
Negative	"Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant: All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
Negative	"Depressing!: I own all of Amy Grant's other CD's and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. I find it amusing that she puts out one of her worst albums ever and her ex-husband (Gary Chapman) puts out one of his best. It seems like she is trying to break out of the ""Gospel & Pop"" mold that made her. I bet she does country (with Vince Gill) next."
Negative	NOT GOOD: Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing? First she gets everyone thinking she's a Christian singer so she doesn't get as much opposition and more positive attention. Then she gets secular and fools those who are too blind to see. If you think ANY of her music will draw you closer to God it won't, and NO MATTER WHAT don't get this CD!
Negative	Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video: If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Granted, the original, out-of-print dvd of The Bikini Carwash Company sells for exorbitant prices, so my suggestion is to just download it for free through torrents and cut the video pirates and video scalpers down to size. If anything, buy the European PAL version, which is also uncut and uncensored, and available on the North American Amazon as well.
Positive	Godd film for when you're in the mood for hotties!: No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex! One hillarious film.
Negative	"don't even bother: this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
Negative	Not worth all that money: The content does not simulate the actual USMLE and there are so many nagatively phrased questions and also, most of the questions are never asked as for as my step1 experience goes.
Negative	Don't waste your money on this: The most unpractical cd i have ever used.A complete waste of money nothing but absurd questions on anatomy and phsiology in step 2
Negative	Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2: I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 ).
Negative	Don't waste your time or money: This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. I don't know who wrote the questions on this program, but they clearly were not familiar with usmle format or usmle content. In agreement with the other reviews, the questions were totally random and kind of off the wall. If they have the audacity to charge 59.00, they should at least live up to the price tag. You are better off using the practice CD that USMLE gives you for free.
Positive	best book I've read in past 5 years: scholarly, well-researched, often humorous look at development of human notions of what is sacred and how it became so.
Positive	good value: if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. this one fit the bill and fits [tightly] in my stabilla 8' case with a level.
Positive	"DELL E207WFP 20.1"" Digital/Analog TFT Flat Panel Monitor: Just a grea product from Dell! I never regret purchasing this lcd monitor though my 17 inch CRT which this replaced was truly sharp. This lcd is totally comparable in sharpness which is a plus when editing your digital pictures. It being flat makes you take back very much needed space, of course. If you only have analog connector on your pc you will still find this lcd okay. I installed a pc card with digital connector on my pc thus allowing its signal to stay digital (versus the pc converting its signal to analog so you could use your crt monitor which is of course analog). With this size, I tend to watch my dvds here than on my 50 inch Regza flat TV."
Positive	Dell E207WFP Monitor: This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well.
Positive	"The King sits on his 70's Throne and I LOVE IT!!!: I've always LOVED this LP and it is one of my All Time Favorites! Lots of Great Soul Music: In The Name, Green Power (MUST HEAR), Dancing In The Street. Some Solid Rockers: Title Track, Midnight Special. Plus a couple of Richard's Over The Top Monologues: Joy To The World (++MUST HEAR++)and Born On a Bayou. In addition, ther is a couple nifty covers: The Way You Do The Things You Do, Brown Sugar, and the magnificent - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry -. I just think this album is FUN. ""King Of Rock and Roll"" gets alot of medicore/negative reviews and I think folks just miss the boat... Would I start my LR Collection here? No. Is it over-produced? Yes. Does it at time sound ""cartoony""? Yes, but if you dig the wild/crazy Little Richard of the 70's - you will eat this album up!!!"
Negative	What's on it: Who would buy it not knowing what is on it, is there any new material, is there a better version of music than previously released, how many, etc., etc. You've got to tell us something - give us a reason to buy it - give us a few short pieces to listen too! King indeed; he's pretty good but the King has been dead awhile (notwithstanding the occasional phantom sighting) and the remaining living creators of original rock and roll - Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry are very much alive and touring and in Jerry Lee's case still recording great music.I'll take a look at buying this if I can see and hear what it is!Jimp.s. sorry for the 1 star but ...
Negative	Hard Times: I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor.
Negative	A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words: This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two.
Negative	Death by verbosity: Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point
Negative	"Soot-covered Sentimentality: Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
Positive	Dark and rich: Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!
Positive	not his best, but pretty good: It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world.
Positive	"The complexity of Dickens: ""Death by verbosity"" describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of ""Great Expectations"". Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."
Negative	Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written: This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read.
Positive	Great Nariation but not that good of a book.: This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature.
Negative	"Underwhelmed: This is not Dickens at his best. No offence to the narrator, who does a good job but I think the story itself is rather boring. Especially when compared with his classics ""Great Expectations"", ""A Christms Carol"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities""."
Positive	"A good, clean book: For my English class, I read Charles Dickens' ""Hard Times."" I chose this book because I have read several of Dickens' works, and I have enjoyed them. I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."
Negative	Zzzzzzz: I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?
Positive	Hard Times...: I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon.
Positive	Beautiful blouse!: I love this blouse! It's nicely cut and quality material. Unfortunately for me I ordered the wrong size and mine isn't available so I have to return it. I'm usually very disappointed in quality when I order clothing online, but risked it and took another chance. I was happily pleased! Plus this is made in the USA, which is very hard to find. I received a little National catalog with the blouse, that I plan to use. Just sad I can't keep this beautiful red blouse...
Negative	"Worst. Movie. Ever.: This is the worst movie ever made. A bold statement, I know, but true nonetheless. It is 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back. The only reason I kept watching is because I told myself: ""Self, there is no way a movie could be this bad. I am sure that they will wrap it all up at the end."" WRONG. The story tried to be some sort of moralistic tale about the dangers of being self involved, but in reality it is a warning of the dangers of hiring a bad director. Please do not watch. And if you do - for the love of all that is quality movie making - DO NOT PAY THE $22 that amazon is charging.Note: The first scene involves a man ripping open his back to pull out an organ. I found this scene ironic because later in the movie I was considering ripping out my own eyeballs."
Positive	Better then the last.: It had more challenges and characters then the 1st Maximum Impact. The original Japanese language makes it better for the fans of the series.
Negative	more of the same: It's *another* King of Fighters game. Don't we already have enough of these already? It's not like this one is drastically different from the other ones.It's basically the same game as all the other King of Fighters but with a 2006 date attached to the title name, which means people will notice it, realize it's brand new, and buy it immediately. Why do we continue to be tormented like this? In a world already loaded with more than enough tournament fighters, I have just this to say- FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
Positive	Great!: This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!
Positive	Nice Album from West Coast!: Good Production,With tons of most loved West Coast Gangsta Rapper support,Snoop Dogg, DPG, RBX, Ras Kass, Kokane, Suga Free Ice Cube....etcStrong West Coast Line up!!!All songs is very good!One of the album that you should purchase for you west coast collections!
Positive	Alittle More Of This and Alittle less of That: Bad Azz is dope and getting better everytime i hear him, however in my opinion its his beats and track selection that will halt his progress in terms of album sales and flava. His first album was good but suffered the same as this album in the fact that there are too many tracks that sound the same because they are so laid back and really lacking alittle liveness or crunkness even though this maybe the style of beat Bad Azz chose because he describes ghetto struggle so well. The best tracks are 'Streetz Illustrated', 'Wrong Idea' and 'How We Do It' with afew others close behind. If Bad Azz can include afew more tracks like these on his albums then he will start to really shine. Buy this album still, because the good tracks are Phat!!!
Positive	Real Tight: A real tight C.D. In my opinion two times better than his original with better production and better lyrics. A couple of tracks were sleepers but without a doubt worth picking up when you see it.
Negative	"I dont feel it: Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
Negative	Down right aweful: I picked this up second hand a couple of weeks ago and I would have been happier to leave it behind. This sounds like a album that producers decided to off load there average beats to, to cash in on some extra doe. Now I dont look at raps as being the issue on rap albums as the raps should only be taken in as an over throw to the beats. The west coast is all about the groove of the music and the rappers slicking there rhymes over the top in mesmeration to these beats. How any of the rappers that feature on this album does this beats me or are they like the producers just cashing in. The good tracks as few as they are on this arnt even that worth repetitive listens. Sorry Bad Azz but if your style incourages beats like this then your crossed off my list.
Negative	Save your money: This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]
Positive	The Safe Place: This story broke my heart. I could not put this book down until I read the whole story. I am amazed at what this child had to go through before someone recognized that she was dyslexic and needed help in order to learn to read. It made me wish that every child had a place they could go where they felt safe and cared about, where no one would make fun of them because they could not read or write or do math, skills that most children take for granted. It made me realize that schools should provide every child a place to go where they felt safe and cared about, a place such as the resource room and teacher as described in this story. It also made me realize how important it is that teachers learn to recognize signs of dyslexia in children in their classrooms and bring it to the attention of appropriate school personnel. This is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend for teachers, parents, and educational/school psychologists to read.
Positive	A delighted Teen: Hey,Jake here. I've watch all the Megaman series from the time I was 6. When the new Megaman NT Worrior series came out I had to watch at least one episode. After that I was hooked. Ever since then I've been waiting for a PET to come out. This toy is the coolest. It lookes exactly like the ones on the show. The battle chips are great too. The only thing I can say is bad is that it olny comes with three chips and as of now there is no way of getting any, unless u buy a figure (...), you can get 1 battle chip per figure. Other than that this is one of the best toys I've seen in a while.
Positive	Possibilities in the Future: Although the PET's are an interesting concept, perhaps you (the customer) should wait until something more hi-tech such as one with a laser pointer acsess and the Net Nabby actually communicates with you. There would also de much better graphics. This computing power isn't feesable now, but if you wait it'll be worth it.
Negative	"are you kidding me?: I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
Positive	Megaman PET: This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i'm 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with
Positive	cool!!!!!!!!: the pet is preety cool its a nice sise and also if u want great game exp. buy more battlechips i cant give this toy 5 stars becuse when u die u need to shake it which is retadrded when i bought it at first i thought it would be a load of crap now i know that and if u buy it i want u to know
Negative	don't buy: I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?
Negative	useless: [...]i said that it was good and fun but i was all wrong. the day i got it after playing with it by myself, it fell then the pet had a scratches and paint bruises (that white mark). the third day i got bored of the same three chips so i brought more, it was expensive and the chips are small. so my little sister already lost half of them (and the chips are easy to spot). the first two weeks it ran out of power, and it has their own special battery,so it was gone (also i forgot to say is the, gameplay of it was bad,and it was imposible to beat somebody with a higher level and better chips unlike yugioh). For kids (like me) don't ask to buy it ,it was hard to find some body with the pet. for parents make sure there is a x on this thing on your child's list,it won't last long (more likely for younger kids). overall to everyone should get the nintendo ds,GBA or atleat the video now thing, this pet is a waste.
Positive	"Cool, man!: My friend had a PET except it was blue. It is unbelievable!!! The only bad thing about it is that u have to shake it 15 minutes to even fight a virus! I want red which is the ""#2"" PET. U should get it. My friend said that he made up a chip called the ""sinqule chip."" He made this ""dementional area"" to do this special power. It's called ""down fusion."" He says that it wastes all off your energy, but in one shot... it defeats the guy your versing! He says only one guy has it. HIM!!!!!! I think he's lieing. But remember... get it!"
Positive	A tight, interesting thriller.: Timothy Hutton plays a Science Fiction author who, although he has written many novels, is best known for his first book about a song that haunted him. The song returns with a vengeance in the film and it is up to him to find a way to stop it from killing others. This was a nice tight thriller with fine acting by Hutton and David Kelly who may be familiar from Charlie and the Chocolate factory or Waking Ned Devine. It kept me guessing until the end (which is fairly hard to do). The background of beautiful Mediterranian locations make this a great movie to help escape from the summer heat.
Negative	Hutton's lost cause: Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film.He plays Science Fiction Author David Norton. He is invited to an island conference. He takes his girl friend, asks her to marry himA DVD appears in his room and she commits suicide..and then more people start dying. He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag. There is no sub plots. The suspense of this film feels disjointed and starts to bore. There are no thrills to capture an audience. Towards the end, Hutton looks bored as lead and the film falls apartTry to miss this one in your video store, until all the other good films are rentedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
Positive	Outstanding movie!: This is an excellent film, with more twists and turns in the plot than a snake in a pretzel factory. Highly recommended!
Negative	I expected more.....: The 2 stars goes to Timothy Hutton for his great performance, truly an outstanding actor! But... the movie... well not so great. I was left somewhat disappointed. It starts well and gives you the impression of a good movie but then it evolves into a bizarre scenario that completely fails to keep up the suspenseful tone of the start, and is in fact rather wearisome and inconclusive at times. It's as if they are trying really hard to achieve a goal with a poor script... I expected more that's all...
Negative	WHAT A WASTE!! DON'T BUY!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!: THIS WASTE OF TIME COST ME TWENTY BUCKS FOR A VIDEO THAT WAS NOT EVEN THIRTY MINUTES!! YOU CAN NOT EXPLORE ANYTHING IN THAT SHORT OF TIME!!!! YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON YOUTUBE FOR FREE!!! DON'T FALL FOR THE SAME TRICK I DID! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
Positive	Egyptian technique: This is a wonderful video. Teachings egyptian technique and combos- I love it. It has helped me become a better dancer.
Negative	difficult to program, no access to manual: Sp65 is difficult to program. Detailed instructions are not included with purchased item, and send you to a web page that is unavailable (www.sonicblue.com/support). I think this is a piece of junk!
Positive	The sinking of the Carl D. Bradley (SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN: I notice the other reviews of this double book ( two books under one title) concern the FIRE AT PESHTIGO. Just is important is the SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN portion. Essentialy this is one of the better accounts of the sinking of the Carl D. Bradley limestone carrier in Northern Lake Michigan November 18, 1958.Author Davenport picks up the story and moves towards the climax from different angles. One aboard a nearby salty freighter, another on board the soon to be doomed ship and still another in the home port of Rogers City Michigan.As a reader of Great Lakes History this accoount is one of the very best. It may be hard to find a copy as it had been over 25 years since it was in print.
Positive	In Nomine Patris et Filii: I love everything on this album. Every song is perfect, the guitars are raw like a rusty chainsaw, and Vikernes sings like he was about to kill someone the second after. Standout tracks: the first song and the 25 mins atmospheric one.If you're a catholic or a believer this is a must.5/5
Negative	I just dont understand: Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Dont get me wrong, I like black metal, and not just the symphonic stuff like Dimmu Borgir and later Emporer. This album i akin to someone pissing in my ear. There is almost no quality in the musicianship. Repetitive and just plain boring. If you want to hear REAL old-school but also excellent BM go and get Satyricon's The ShadowThrone and anything by Mayhem. Dont waste your time with this drivel. im not a kid either but beleive what you will.
Negative	Count Grishnak pales in comparison to Euronymous: Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem. The music is not too bad, but Grishnak deserves no attention for his deeds.
Positive	Colorful Overview of the Islands: What a pleasure to read such a high-quality book... It introduces each of the islands in a colorful and vivid way. The book includes many pictures, and provides a fine insight into the culture and character of the islands and touches on history, people, travel, activities, sights, nature, and a lot more.However, if you are looking for a book with accurate travel information, e.g. hotels, restaurants, prices/dates, how to get there, etc., this book is on the weaker side. Use it together with the Frommer's Caribbean guide for a combination that is hard to beat. Despite this weakness, it's still a five star on my bookshelf.
Positive	An Unfound Gem: This band has a straight forward approach to music that is sturdy, simple, aggressive and a little annoying, in a good way. The often frenetic lead guitar is right up front to create a classic rustic American sound. This band must like Blind Willie McTell as they cover Dying Crapshooters Blues and mention Mctell in their original track Down at Danny's. If you are looking for something different with a classic American roots music sound - this is a nice find.
Negative	DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS BRA!: This bra is completley worthless! It offers absolutely no support, is cheaply made and does not run according to size. Don't waste a penny on this. You will be disappointed.
Negative	ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!: i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
Negative	Nice bra, but sizes run LARGE: I love the style of the bra, however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size. The label read 46D (which I know I wear), but had to send it back because the cup was just too LARGE.
Negative	"""March of the Saint"" is the one to find...: I remember Armored Saint from their tour opening for WASP and Metallica. L'Amour in Brooklyn. These guys ROCKED. Unfortunately this album, lacking second guitarist Phil Sandoval, does not rock. Poor production values, even explained on the liner, makes it even less acceptable. I gave it the second star only because it was great to hear ""Can U Deliver?"" again and I can't find the now out of print ""March of the Saint"" first album. Buy it if you're a die-hard Saint fan like myself, but if you're looking for a good Saint album currently available get ""Symbol Of Salvation"" instead. It's pretty rockin'."
Positive	"amazing: ""Motor City Moments"" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, ""Don't Git Sassy"" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune ""For Somoeone I Love,"" where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like ""The Love Theme from Spartacus."" Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone."
Positive	Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream.: I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again.
Positive	Great CD: Love Regina's work, love Jazz. I am a violinist and love hearing the violin played in different genre's love what she does
Negative	"violin w/a kick: Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry ""Forever February"" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Don't Mess With Mr. T"" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances."
Positive	"TRUE WORSHIP: Nomatter what I am going through, Darien and LW's music is always able to bring my back into focus. If you are looking for a true worship album, this is the ONE!! There are lots of ""worshippers"" and commercialized gospel singers out there doing the best they can, but you can tell when the focus goes away from the Lord. Darien's writing stays true to the reason we sing, and that is the Almighty King. You will fall down on your knees. You will dance and shout in praise! BUY THIS ALBUM - IT WILL BE THE BEST SPIRITUAL INVESTMENT YOU EVER MAKE (AFTER ACCEPTING CHRIST)!"
Positive	FRUSTRATING OMMISIONS: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VIDEO COMPILATION AS PERFECT DUE TO A NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE OMMISIONS. ALONG WITH IGNORING THE TELEVISION PERFORMANCES FOR 'STARMAN' AND 'REBEL REBEL', THERE ARE NO VIDEOS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1973 AND 1977, A TIME IN WHICH BOWIE HAD MANY FANTASTIC SINGLES INCLUDING 'FAME', TVC15', 'GOLDEN YEARS' AND 'SOUND AND VISION'. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS A MUST FOR BOWIE FANS. HIGHLIGHTS: 'LIFE ON MARS', BE MY WIFE', BOYS KEEP SWINGING', 'CHINA GIRL' AND THE BEST VIDEO OF THE LOT- 'ASHES TO ASHES'.
Positive	C'est magnifique! il y a du vrai dans ce qui'l dit.: Il y a des temps que Mr. Coello nous avons donné une histoire de honor et de mystère. Cet histoire étre publié en different langues. Je l'ai li en anglais et en franais seulement. La histoire rendu étai fidèle, excellent, et grand. Il raconte du rve de un bon garon que cherche le monde pour trouver un inconnu trésor. Il l'a réussi...mais... Je suis certain qui il a trouvé deux trésors... voila! vous devez lire la histoire maintenant pour découvrir le mystére; s'il vous plait.
Negative	The Alchemist: Sure this is an interesting book. Unfortunately the copy we received was written in spanish!
Positive	a new king: Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died. The grand father skipped over his son (a fat gross slob) to give Steve the medallion and the ring of kingship. This set off a war.Gypsies are mostly known for their grift, scams and cons but when called upon they can fight and kill too. Several attempts are made on his life but he survives. Read this book and see what happens.Steve tells author Peter Maas that he wants to change and he wants to change the way the gypsies live. The book ends there and we do not know if he was successful. The book is very very short. You can read it almost in 1 sitting. Some of the reviews are longer than the book.bbp okc ok2009
Positive	Inside a Secret Nation: I bought this book on ebay, as it's been out-of-print for years. Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's. The telephone psychic industry probably cut into the market for fortune-tellers, so I wonder if the women now have regular jobs?
Positive	Aids in hands-free phone usage: I use this phone holder every day on my commute, in conjunction with an auto charger and hands-free earset. I find it indispensable in securely fastening the phone in place, yet easily removable. It makes one-hand dialing easy, and I don't have to worry about the phone sliding around because of sudden turns or stops. One word of note: it doesn't accept the use of oversize extended-life batteries.
Positive	Riveting: One of the best suspense books I have had the pleasure to read. The characters are a dynamic mix that make the story had to put down. You develop and understanding for the villian were you empathize with him while at the same time you feel for the hero and heroine to catch him. A must read for those who like suspense novels.
Negative	I did not like it. Messy: I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine.
Negative	Uninspired: Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry.
Negative	DRACULA SUCKS: Too many characters that appear for a sentence or two and then just vanish into the London fog of the late 19th century.
Negative	Come Watson, the games afoot!: Unfortunately, it's two left feet on this occasion. I bought the book as I am a big fan of both Holmes and Dracula stories, but despite the sometimes colorful characters, it was a tedious read.
Negative	Waaaaay too much in this book for a mere 350 pages: This book needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book.
Positive	"Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully ""out"". Living people (referred to as ""warm"") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."
Negative	Anno Dracula Boring: The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. The characters were not believable and left me with wanting to many unanswered questions. The author took to many liberties with facts. All in all, I just didn't care for the book, skipped thru pages to end it so I could go on to more enjoyable reading. Amazon offers so many options and choices that I'm bound to pick a lemon once in awhile. I always read the brief description of the book before I buy but in this book that wasn't enough.
Negative	Too many names, too little interest.: This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun.
Positive	Please make a reprint of this book.: For me, Steampunk started with this book. It brought to me the beauty and anachronisms of the Victorian culture mixed with the surprises and action of modern sci/fi. My wife, who loves vampire stories probably even more than I do, had never read the book and when I went about trying to find a copy of it for her, it seemed impossible. Thank god for the internet (and to a lesser extent, Amazon). I was finally able to get a used hardback for a sum that wasn't too insulting. My wife tore through it and loved the weirdness as much as I do. It is crazy that this book has not had a recent reprint. Who ever is responsible for that should be slapped once or twice.
Positive	So glad Titan Books Reprinted this!!: It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. How would the presence of vampires change Victorian, England? This is exactly what Mr. Kim Newman tackles in his thriller novel 'Anno Dracula'. Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this! I hope they continue with the sequel Anno Dracula: The Bloody Red Baron, which takes place in 1918, or I will have to get crafty and find an old copy myself!
Positive	"Enthralling: I'm very glad to have discovered this original, complicated but enthralling book by Kim Newman. In this take-off of Bram Stokers Dracula, the Count survived execution and went on to become the consort of Queen Victoria in 1888. England is made up of the ""un-dead"" and the ""warm,"" and when a killer 'Silver Knife' begins murdering vampire prostitutes, they must work together to track him down. Many names from the original Dracula, as well as other literary works find this way into the story, which is fun.I had a little trouble sticking with this book at first--it is quite complex and with many characters--but once I got pulled in, I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this for fans of the original Dracula."
Positive	"Alternate History meets Classic Horror: Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, ""Anno Dracula"" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks. If you liked Dracula and don't mind the occasional ""What If"" scenario then you might want grab a copy of this hard to find gem."
Positive	Difficult, but all-around enjoyable: Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of.
Negative	Anno dracula: Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea.
Positive	"Great for drivers awareness: I have read some of the reviews and it appears to me that the ones who don't like this book are the children who had to read it. First of all this book is not written for each state, so you will have to check on your own state or county laws along with this book. As for this book not helping you pass the ""TEST"". Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the ""TEST"", which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them. But we as adults must continue the teach, and hope that some of what they read sinks in. When dealing with driving a vehicle, learning by experience a lot of times ends up to late. This book doesn't teach you how to pass the ""TEST"" it teaches you how to be a better driver, something we all need to be..."
Positive	Boring but useful: I must admit, this book is pretty lame in its organization and all. But there was still a load of stuff that I wouldn't have known, so there is some useful content here. (Heh...I couldn't have passed my test without it...)
Negative	Not worth your time!: As of now I am completing drivers Ed. We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual. If you think this will help you, try it, but I warn you, its not worth it. Your state drivers manual is worth you time, check it out!
Negative	No Editor? Mediocre Content.: After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future.
Positive	Read this if you carry concealed: This is an in-your-face, tell it like it is, discussion of the good and bad of carrying a concealed weapon. The snap decisions you might make under extreme pressure may have dire consequences unless you understand what you can and cannot do to defend yourself.Very enlightening. A quick read on a very serious matter.
Positive	"A ""must read"" for any handgun owner: I ordered this on a recommendation from a coworker. He is a former Sheriff's Deputy and is thoughtful and level-headed. The information in the book is well reasoned and clearly explained and should be required reading for any new handgun owner or those considering a gun purchase for self-protection."
Negative	Good ONLY for total beginner: I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
Positive	Armed Response: is essential: If your looking for a great book that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. A great place to start be it a beginner or old timer this is a must read. David Kenik not only wrote well but put it in a format that is understandable. Well thought out! This is a must have book for anyone who wants to understand what is needed to justify an armed response. It does not replace personal training or what can be learned in a class (interaction). It does however build a great foundation for what is needed to to understand in responding with lethal force. If you own a firearm for personal protection than you need to own this book.
Positive	"EXCELLENT FOR NOVICE OR EXPERT: For 36 years I have instructed a wide variety of novices, experts and ""so-called"" experts. This book will take you from nothing - to all you really need to know (unless you are into ""one-upsmanship"" or trying to prove something about your masculinity or lack of it). For those (who are using this forum to display their resumes) if you are insecure then you will take your stack of books and your ego and look for anything that might have been left out. You might even list all the books you have, but the truth is, if you are really good at real-life situations, whether actual military combat, law enforcement or the usual combat games, ....all the book-learning in the world is no replacement. This book is well worth what you pay for it, and that's the point of these reviews, not better-than-thou cynicism from would be intellectuals."
Positive	Armed Response: This is a very good book for the person who plans to carry concealed firearms. The logic is clear and the recommendations are sound. Unfortunately, the proof reading is atrocious. In the early chapters paragraphs are repeated and there are other other problems. I lined out several sentences that were misplaced and had to tape in a loose page that came with the book. The book is sound and I would have given it a 5 if the proof reader had not messed it up.
Positive	Book: Armed Response: A good book for Self-Defense folks. I was hoping for something new but it pretty much reiterated what we already know (preaching to the choir). Not a bad evening read.
Positive	Informative: The book, although hard to get excited about in the begining, offers insight into confrontations that you experience any given day during your life. It's thorough and offers helpful ideas.
Negative	Wasn't Impressed: Lots of diagrams and drawings, pointing arrows, etc. I felt as though I were back in class and was missing the required supplementary workbook.This book seems to address mainly work situations where the reader is the boss and having difficulty with a recalcitrant employee. There just wasn't much for me here to apply to my own life.
Positive	LIFE CHANGINGING BOOK: THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ( WORK,RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME,FRIENDS),IF YOU UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK.IT CHANGED MY LIFE.MANY THANKS TO THE AUTHORS.
Positive	Crucial Confrontations: A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship. Found it useful at work as a reference book, plus a great read for personal relationship communications as well. Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view.
Negative	Old information: Unfortunately, I did not like this book. I found it difficult to read and boring, even though it was recommended by a friend..
Positive	"TERRIFIC BOOK: I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."
Positive	conversation tools: I liked the book and definitely picked up on tools for working thru violated expectations. Everyone could take away and use something from this book. Well worth the $s spent.
Positive	Great job: I appreciate the books a great deal. They are wonderful tools for improving communication, which is something we all need, and especially when the stakes are high. Great book.
Positive	An excellent approach to interacting management: I had a wonderful time reading the book (and taking notes). It reminded me of the multiple occasions in which I have failed for lack of skills, but also showed me that there is a methodology to follow next time I have to confront a violated expectation (probably within the next five minutes)
Positive	Can't get too much of a good thing.: In Crucial Confrontations these 4 author/practitioners continue on the Crucial Conversation path. They begin with definitions of terms, move to concrete examples and provide useful tools for improving dialogue in tough situations, in all aspects of life and work.The ability to have a tool for measuring your abilities in holding crucial confrontations is appealing as we all like to know where we stand. They also offer lots of tools on their website that supports this current work - www.crucialconfrontations.comThere are no absolutes for how we hold crucial confrontations and these 4 authors provide a template from which to work so that anyone can be successful. Authentic, Credible and great to know you are not alone in this navigation toward improved communications.
Positive	NIkon EG-D2 Audio Video Cable for Nikon: This item is very well built, and works great with the Nikon Camera it was purchased to support. I recommend this item.
Positive	great accessary: recently,I purchased a nikon camera.this is a great addition for my camera.I am able to see my pictures immediatly on the television.
Positive	4,5 stars Amazing album: If you like Slayer then this is a must album. The drums with Dave Lombardo are once again simply perfect. The songs are very rhytmic and aggressive. The sound of the guitars and the vocals are really great. Just buy this album .
Positive	GREAT BOOK IN EVERY WAY: This is the ultimate book on Bettie Page. This book is for every true Bettie fan. Even contains an introduction from Bettie herself.If you really want to follow the history of legend, this is the ultimate book on Betty Mae Page!
Positive	Uncovering the rage about Bettie Page: After years of seclusion, most of the secrets of, by and about Bettie Page are revealed in this well-composed and long overdue profile of the most photographed model in history.Ms. Page may still wonder at the inspiration and sensation (and consternation from members of Congress) she caused in the mid-1950's...what this book clearly does, is testify as to why her image is still sought after by fans and collectors.Easy, lively reading and plenty of pictures rates this as the best book available on the Page rage.
Positive	Admirable!: Based on her theosophic and new thought principles, these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence. Truly a most inspirational woman!
Negative	Not for me: I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. I deleted it soon after.
Negative	Great Record, Bad Remaster: I love this record. And I am also a big fan of remastered re-releases (Bowie, Roxie, etc.), but I was disappointed in the sound of this remaster. My Import version sounds MUCH better...a lot more raw, more vital, better definition between instruments. This sounds like a lot of compression, and not much more. Buy this record, but don't re-buy it for a better experience like I did.
Positive	Great resource: I loved looking at this book. It covered a lot of variety of types of chests and provided interesting historical and culture facts, as well as personal stories for specific chests. The pictures to text ratio is perfect. I wish there was a little more information on consrtuction--there was some useful information on types of construction for the wood itself, but I would have liked to see information on materials/woods used, latches, locks, handles, and strapping/corners. Still, I am very happy with my purchase.
Positive	Overall Good Book: Book was great and a nice read... but the cover was dirty, don't know why Amazon would sell a dirty book.
Negative	An adventure story that fails: This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read.
Positive	Cute book and a fast read: Absolutely charming book, great for all grade levels. I usually run for the gory, werewolfie or anne boleynesque books, but it was refreshing to pick up something sweet AND interesting for a change. Buy this for the MG reader in your life, but read it for yourself first!
Positive	Good book for young teens: Ok, the kids accused me of reading it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids.
Positive	"Riding in Cars or Boats with Kids: .Tom Bodett - the ""We'll leave the light on"" Motel 6 guy - wrote and performs this cautionary tale of respect for the whims of Nature for kids and their parents. Part ""slice of life"" in the Alaskan ""bush,"" part sociology - can ""bush"" and ""town"" kids find common ground and interests? and also a warning on why kids should listen to grown-ups (all these years and we really HAVE learned something ;-), this captivating adventure will while away the hours whilst travelling."
Negative	"Keep looking - this ain't it!: I have to agree with the ""lousy"" review. It seems to be a decent setup,but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available, what is the point? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster ""shutter"" speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture. I wasn't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera, but this was a total loss. Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization?"
Negative	"This item is a total scam: This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
Positive	THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!!!!: The finest pop songwriters get a piece of their due with this three disc set. There were no finer writers than HDH during the second half of the twentieth century and this set is testimony to that. Sadly, most of these songs are available elsewhere and avid Motown fans will find this redundant. Great mono versions of a good chunk of their biggest hits but a second volume is called for with more of the post Motown output and a deeper look into the vaults for demos of some of the literally hundreds of top shelf songs these guys wrote. How did they do it? Don't have a clue but I sure do love these songs...
Positive	"Excellent overview: This overview of the trio's songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you already own 75% of the songs. Has rare mono mixes of Freda Payne's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Chairmen Of The Board's ""Give Me Just A Little More Time."" Informative liners notes."
Positive	An Excellent DVD Concert: As a survivor of the Woodstock generation these artists play the music I love to hear. The musicians are in excellent shape, the line-up is superb, the selections are well-chosen and the DDS 5.1 mix is a showroom example of a proper live concert mix. Ambient and live but clear and focused. All in all an excellent sounding DVD of some top-flight musicians and songwriters strutting their finest stuff with Sir George Martin adding some very fine string embellishments to many of the songs. If you like these artists and their music this DVD will not disappoint you.
Positive	Excellent DVD: Music for Montserrat is an exceptional DVD. Every artist, Eric Clapton, Paul Mc Cartney, Elton John, just to name a few are wonderful and the sound is amazing. A great addition to anyone's DVD collection.
Positive	rare concert, awesome audio: I recently watched this at a friend's house. He has an excellent surround sound setup and this DVD has DTS. amazing.as a habit I don't like live concert video - rarely buy them.the guest artists are phenomenal - Paul McCartney at the end is lots of fun/great songs.How many times are you going to see Clapton and Knopfler playing together, filmed well and in DTS?you just can't go wrong with this DVD.
Positive	Outstanding content: I have a $20,000 stereo with DTS, SACD 3100 watts. This is far and away one of the best content, musicians, songs etc... that I own. The sound quality is a 4 out of 5 but the songs and musicians more than make up for it. A definite must for any audiophile.
Positive	"Great Music: This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
Positive	Great if you have the RIGHT sound setup: I almost sent this item back because the sound was so uneven going back and forth between loud and soft for no reason. luckily I ran across a comment by someone who mentioned you had to use 5.1 or DTS in the sound setup to get it to work right. Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect. After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others. Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in. If you think you might like this DVD you will, so buy it, just be sure you use 5.1 or DTS!
Positive	"Very Nice!: Phil Collins singing ""Take Me Home"" and Mark Knopfler performing ""Brothers in Arms"" and ""Money for Nothing"" are fantastic; heck, Elton, McCartney, Sting, Eric Clapton, Sting, Jimmy Buffett, Carl Perkins and Arrow are all great. This is a wonderful concert; I just wish I could have heard it in person.This DVD looks fantastic and sounds terrific--especially on a DTS capable system like mind. I buy music DVD's only if I can see that they have DTS encoding on the disk (Amazon please take note). However, in a few places--just a couple--the sound quality of ""Music for Monserrat"" falls down a wee bit compared to other music DVD's I have; otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.That said, this is a great DVD for those like me who love these artists."
Negative	Audio= Very Poor: First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine. Suggest you try something else.
Negative	poor sound mix on many of the tracks: Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality.
Positive	10 stars: This is one of the best video concerts ever. The sound, visuals and performances are top notch. It is a real joy. I have owned it a week and watched it 3 times already. Every performance is good. There are no dead spots during this concert and you get quite a number of them. A keeper. Memorable.
Negative	McCartney Lovers Only: I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead.
Positive	Definitely a collector's item.: It is extremely rare to see so many world famous super artists performing together in the same concert doing some of their greatest hits - Elton John, Sting, Mark Knofler, Carl Perkin, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Phil Colins etc. You must own this DVD before it is out of stock. I would have given it 5 stars should the audio recording be slightly better. Go and buy this one with confidence. I am sure you will not regret.
Positive	"All-Star Lineup: This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
Negative	Disappointed with the sound quality: If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore.
Positive	This is a concert.: The world's best performers together. I guess the only one missing was Peter Gabriel, but oh well, he missed it.Extremely recommendable.
Positive	Josef Strauss and the Family Formula.: London-born violinist and conductor John Georgiadis is in charge here, exhuming and enlivening long-forgotten dance music from the pen of Josef Strauss. After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule. Reliance on the family formula seems evident in most of the items on this CD, where you'll find a spanking little march, three waltzes, a quadrille and a variety of polkas, heard best at concert hall volume so that subtle lifts in rhythm and phrase and the skilful orchestration are heard to best advantage.
Positive	Good Lens Cap: This is a good lens cap and does meet the purpose. Personally, I wish it had a hole in it so it could be attached to the camera like the original lens cap that came with the camera.
Positive	Does what it says.: $9 isn't too bad for an OEM replacement lens cap. Needed to pick one up after mine was lost in the snow while skiing this winter. It works.
Negative	Cannot Recommend It: This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo.
Negative	Not enough information. Cap did not fit my model.: The item was not fully described. I thought it would fit my Rebel camera,however it did not.Nor
Positive	More pricy, but nice to use: True, it is more expensive than non-Canon caps, but after all you are using it a hundred times on a photography day and it works the best (I have a $5 non-Canon one and every time I had to use it it felt cheap and flimsy). Just another small thing to enjoy your shooting more.One star off, as it still could be 30% cheaper.
Positive	Quality product: Fits as expected and is well made. It lacks a cord to tether it to your camera but you can easily purchase one that sticks on the front if you feel you need one. I however prefer to just keep the cap in my pocket when the camera is in use so its not flopping around and getting in the way.
Positive	Very good: I bought this lens cap as replacement for my stock on canon 70-200 F/4 none is L lens after I misplaced it.It fits perfectly good build quality from a plastic.
Positive	Lens Cap: This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
Positive	Funny!: I bought three copies of this book as funny Christmas presents, and they were a big hit. One of the people I gave it to, just after opening it, began to read several small sections aloud to the rest of us, and it was very entertaining.
Negative	Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available: With all of the program changes, this book is very out of date. You can get a lot of the same information for free at http://www.certificationguide.com
Negative	Decent start, then rambled: This book started out fairly interesting as being an insight to the impact of too much money on children and the relationship with their parents. Then, it goes into what one reviewer thought might be an opium trip (which I agree with) that went on and on and on, boring after the first couple pages. The end was so predictable, the entire book turned into a major disappointment.
Positive	IMHO not for children: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again.
Positive	Great for kids of all ages: Delightful story. The plot accomodates itself to children of all ages. Plenty of action, humor, and silliness - the ingredients my children seem to thrive on. Stuart is about a kid trying to find his place in the world. And aren't we all?
Negative	"1 hour of static rain noise: Ok i admit. I'm not a brain music expert. I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say ""do not use while operating heavy machinery"" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."
Positive	be careful with size: Great boot. Seems like it ran large. I usually wear a size 9 athletic shoe and sandal but this 9 swallowed my foot whole. Maybe it's becasue my foot is a bit narrow. No trouble returning and swapping for an 8 1/2. Solestruck is an excellent company to deal with. Great customer service!!I love these boots!
Negative	Disappointing - additional equipment needed: We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom. After reading the reviews and descriptions we ordered this tape. On receiving it we found that every participant needs a set of dumbbells and ankle weights. Nowhere did we see indications that additional additional equipment was needed. We are now deciding whether to return this tape unopened. Please be aware that this tape is of dubious benefit unless you have access to dumbbells (the bar-bell type, not the student type) and ankle weights.
Positive	Great Story!: I read this book in one day. That's a big deal for me. I thought the author did a fantastic job.
Negative	Lots of adjectives, adverbs, and cliches: The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style.
Negative	"Where is the ""Truth"": As a St. Louis resident during this crime, I was especially interested in this book. I was very disheartened when I heard Ms. Cummins interviewed on the radio and a police detective called in and challenged her account, claiming that she misquoted him. It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things."
Positive	Greased Lightning: This story will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn't let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed. The lesson to be learned from this book, is that the majority of us at one time or another have walked to the fringe and escaped unchanged and luckier then we can imagine . A horrific tale that hopefully will save others a simliar FATE, It's difficult to comprehend that this is just one family's tragedy out of the thousands of cries of anguish that go on in silence. Trust me (or not), don't miss this book !
Positive	A Page Turner: I read the review on this book in People Magazine and finished it in three days. It was a very well researched book and a real tribute to the Author's family. The whole family has a gifting in the written word, Tink, Robin, & Julie. The book was an easy read. I recommend you check it out.
Positive	A Rip in Heaven: A very sad story of 2 lives lost,but they are remembered by there family. VERY true but sad story. RIP Julie and Robin Kerry.
Positive	A Wonderful Composition: Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story.
Positive	Good, fast reading story: This book was referred to me by a friend and it turned out to be a story that I coulnd't put down. From the beginning, it is a great story that captured my attention and brought a new realization to the happenings of the world around me. Overall, it was a fantastic read and something that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good book based on a true story.
Positive	"Tugs at Your Heart Strings: ""An excellent memoir and true crime saga. It made me think about some issues, such as the death penalty and victims' rights. It took me about 50 pages or so to really get into it, then I couldn't put it down."""
Positive	Riveting: I too read this book quickly, staying up one night until 2 or 3 in the morning, and I was riveted. I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young.
Positive	"A families point of view: I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
Positive	Out Standing: I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book.
Positive	Good quality: I have bought two of these, about a year apart.The last one i bought had a nicer finish to the edges, not just cut leather.Really nice, and i get compliments all the time on it.
Positive	"Enter Slayer: Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. 1, which is noteworthy for introducing the world to Metallica, Metal Massacre III's major claim to fame is that it unleashed thrash legends Slayer.The early Metal Massacre compilations are the best reflection of the American metal scene at the time, as such this 1983 release is full of power, traditional, and proto-thrash metal bands that are all clearly influenced by the NWOBHM scene. In addition to some of the ""name"" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene. These Metal Massacre albums are a great way to revisit that era, and are a must-have for all old-school metalheads."
Negative	NOT what I ordered!: I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get.
Positive	3 years later, it's still chugging along perfectly...: I noticed a few reviews complaining about their extension cords breaking down after just few months of usage, so I decided to let you all know that after nearly THREE years of use, mine works just as good as it did on day 1. It was cheap, does what it's supposed to, and hasn't failed me yet. Buy with confidence!
Negative	I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful.: I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
Negative	cheap, but not worth the money: This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement.
Negative	Defective and more?: I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal.
Positive	It works with my seven year old Sony Bravia: My husband is using the 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension to watch TV, with my seven year old Sony Bravia, while I listen to my audiobooks on my iPod. We have a very quiet home. He is happy with the sound.
Negative	hmmmmmm!: i bought this so i can watch tv from the other side of the room. great idea. but some headsets dont work with it.. would have returned it but for the price ill keep it. you get what u pay for!
Positive	AWESOME: i bought for my dad so he doesn't have to sit 3 feet away from the TV while my mom is sleeping. Now he can sit on the bed and lay down with another 5 ft to spare..
Positive	headphone extension.: almost a year of use, and it still works great, this runs from our tv, to my treadmill, I exercise 6 days a week, and this is a fantastic extension.
Positive	Works as desired: Not completely perfect, but reliable, and frankly, it extends the reach of my headphones. This is all I need it to do.
Positive	works great: I use this to listen to ear buds at work but the computers are hidden under the desk so this allows me to have access to the jack. i can move around my cubicle with ease with these.
Positive	Good deal: I am am a musician so I use these with earbuds coming off my computer within my headphones which is powered from my Marshall Amplifier. They transfer the sound well and are very well made.
Positive	Does what it should do.: Works fine, seems to be as well made as you are going to get in a cheap consumer electronics accessory. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday - can't beat that for service.
Positive	Much better quality than expected: I've noticed very little degrading of the sound, if at all, and this is rare in most extensions. The cord is thicker than usual for both the positive and negative polarities - a separate wire for each - and I'm quite pleased with this, will perhaps get another because of its thickness. I now have great headphone sound within a twenty-foot range - just what I was looking for. Even if you don't need 15-feet of cord, I would recommend this over the shorter 10 foot cords where the wiring is about half as thick and not likely to hold up over time...I subject all my electronics to heavy use. Plus, the best extensions for Grado headphones go for $40, and I'm quite satisfied saving over $30 by having this one.
Positive	Works Great: Had this for almost two years because my computer jack is too far away to reach. Now I have found multiple uses for it. I can walk on my treadmill in my basement without having to turn up the volume on my tv. I just hook this up to the receiver and to my headphones, and I'm all set. I can even listen/watch media on my laptop with this extender while on the treadmill too. For the price, it's an excellent bargain.
Negative	Good for about 1.5 years....: I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half.
Negative	Stopped working after 2 months: Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
Negative	Stopped working after a week.: Can't return, I guess, don't know how to get a hold of seller. Connections not good, I only get left ear speaker to work w/cord but without it works headphones work fine. So it's the cord. It's a shame really as the cord it self seems to be of good quality. Oh well, you can't judge a book by it's cover.
Negative	poor fit ruins sound - avoid this product: Product arrived promptly and in good condition. However, the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones. If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault
Positive	Sounds good: Sound quality is good for such an inexpensive item and long enough to let me move freely around in my office. Meets my needs
Positive	Good Value: This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great.
Positive	Good: What can you say about cables, either they work or they dont't. This cable funtioned as expected and the quality was good. A good deal at the price.
Positive	Exactly as described, 15 feet of stereo 3.5mm headphone cable: Works as described, no distortion issues. I use this in my workout room so I can watch TV and wear headphones while I run.
Negative	Didn't get what I ordered: I ordered the headphone extension (1 male end/1 female end) and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug (2 male ends). I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back.
Positive	It works!: It's good price and works as expect. After a month of use it still going strong. The plug is sung. It keeps the headphone attached firmly.
Negative	Sound Quality is Lacking: Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product. Glad I didn't waste more than I did on this.
Negative	Great idea but mine's broken: Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now...
Positive	"How Fun!: What fun it is to read a novel by one of my favorite ""corporate"" writers! This is a definite departure from the more business-like stylings of ""Diversity Blues - How to Shake Them"". I found myself drawn into the story, not only by the character development - but also by the subject matter. Without giving away any details, I'd like to say it's thought provoking and entertaining! A great drizzly afternoon read and a brain-teaser to boot. A reminder that you may not be as ""enlightened"" as you think you are!!"
Positive	"Impressive and entertaining!: Once I picked it up, I found it very hard to put it down again and ended up reading into the wee-hours of the late evenings! Ms. Gossett's storytelling and ability to keep the reader in suspense was amazing! As I was reading it, I felt Ms. Gosssett was there in the room with me telling me a story!I also loved how she craftfully weaved in diversity themes throughout and it was refreshing to read a story based in Cincinnati where I have lived and worked.It was a real treat living out the story plot and trying to play out in my mind - Who dunnit? I was surprised at the ending and with the very last cliffhanger. I truley believe this would make for a great suspense movie and the book is as good as any Grisham novel I've read (and I have read them all!)!Kudos to Ms. Gossett who has ""come into her own"" and deserves so much success with this book!"
Positive	Beautiful and well made!: Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star. The opinion of his contemporaries that Raff was one of the greats is borne out here. The 2nd movement is so lyrical, it is worth the price of the disk by itself. The orchestra, though perhaps not well known, gave an outstanding performance. It is a pity that my CD from Amazon contained no program notes unlike what another reviewer reported. However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!
Negative	Melancholy views and interpretations: This book, was far too long, and was not at all appealing. The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories.
Negative	Not Worth the Effort: It is very hard to find the logic in believing Freud when he himself was quite mentally disturbed and sick. Freud rationalizes things to death, he gives no hope, and removes all magic from the world. It seems, finally, that Freud is falling into disrepute after some years of popularity. He was never correct, only popular. If you want really important work in the field, then read Karl Gustav Jung, because, as I mentioned in the title, Freud is not worth reading.
Negative	"A New Translation: This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."
Negative	Laughing out loud: As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.
Negative	No Table of Contents: Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me.
Negative	Poor Quality Binding: Though the content of the text met expectations (it's a fairly canonical text), the binding on this book was terrible. It does not include any print or publishing information, making it nearly impossible to cite. There is neither table of contents nor an index, inexcusable for a text of this length and genre. The section breaks were unpredictable and poorly marked. Some new paragraphs began mid-sentence (clearly errors!) and often the section heading was indistinguishable from the paragraph in which it was imbedded. I highly suggest spending the money on a better quality version of the text.
Negative	translator confusion: I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the ebook is J.A. Underwood.While this may be OK for the casual reader, this is not OK for someone approaching these texts in any kind of rigorous fashion.Whatever carelessness accounts for this error, it is enough to make me opt for a good old fashioned paperback instead.Fix it!
Negative	It was a waste of money and time.: It's not at all what I expected. Still have not found what I was looking for in thefirst place
Negative	disappointment: Was poor quality and some of the original text was not included- was not as described -should be removed from Amazon
Positive	A New Older Edition: This 2005 publication is A.A.Brill's revised translation of Freud's masterpiece, its 3rd German ed. (1911). There were five more editions (to 1929), which are integrated in the standard edition translation by James Strachey (Avon/Discus pb 1965). This one, however, benefits from a creative intro by Daniel O'Hara and Gina MacKenzie, who correct some of the translation in an appendix, adding endnotes, comments, questions and valuable suggestions for further reading.
Positive	"the hidden meaning of dreams: The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's ""Interprettation of Dreams"" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
Negative	Hard read: Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary. Not worth it if you're not actually studying the subject or have advanced interest in psycho-analysis.
Negative	Very bad edition: This edition is really bad. It is really ugly and has a lot of typos. I do not trust the translation either; it does not even specify who the translator is.
Negative	"Don't buy NuVision Edition: I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
Negative	Terrible book: My professor was not happy with this rendition of the book.He felt it was interpreted poorly and wanted me to buy another book.
Positive	triplets: this is a different kind of movie and I love it. so very glad I found and ordered it. it's amazing. this came securely wrapped, great delivery, and quality dvd satisfied with service, and movie
Positive	strangely wonderful: If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you.
Positive	TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME SOUNDTRACK: Triplets of Belleville soundtrack and Belleville Rendevous are the same disc. The first is the USA version and the second is the UK version - the playlists are identical. They are being offered here as a two disc deal, but unless you're some sort of completist, this is no deal. I advised Amazon of this.
Positive	"Amazing...but technology has its drawbacks: I first heard the Belleville Rendez-vous while watching the Academy Awards, and I have hardly stopped listening to this fantastic soundtrack since I got it in the mail yesterday! Jazzy, organic and original it's fun to listen to.But you should note that the CD has some sort of copy control technology on it -- it says in small print ""On some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered"". Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn't recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player. I'm not quite sure what to do about this glitch, and I'm not willing to part with the soundtrack, but this aspect of the CD sure is annoying."
Positive	"In the vein of ""Chocolat"": What a delightful work of art. I was enchanted with the film and the music definitely caught my attention. I'm always looking for a little ""off beat"" music, i.e., Chocolat was my last favorite CD, but now this has moved up to first place. I highly recommend it for ecclectic music lovers who like that ""off beat, out of the way, different"" sound."
Positive	"Erreur: ""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" n'a pas reu le Jutra de la meilleure bande sonore, puisqu'il n'était pas en nomination. ""Gaz Bar Blues"" l'a remporté."
Negative	The Triplets of Belleville: This a terrible story - boring at best. I am sorry I wasted my time watching it.
Positive	A Smart and Sensitive Look at Power and Oppression: On the surface, this book offers startlingly beautiful language and heart-stopping imagery. But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art.
Positive	"The Missing Link: ""Other Side of Love"" was never released on either of Yazoo's albums. It was released as a single between the two albums. After years of searching I finally found it on CD!!""Other Side"" is a happy upbeat tune that has a bit that sounds like ""Just Can't Get Enough"" which after all Vince wrote for Depeche Mode.If you have both albums get this single and complete your Yazoo songlist!"
Positive	"For 4 year olds AND 1 year olds!!!!!: Would you believe that my 1 year old dances to this? I bought it for my daughter, who is 4 years old, and when my toddler hears the music, he comes racing in and starts bouncing around. It is a great piece...very educational, extremely easy to follow with or without the dancers on the video (we have the music CD), and I don't mind playing it at all. My daughter's favorites are ""Shake a Leg"", ""The Circus Dance"", and when ""The Bingo Rainbow"", she runs around the house trying to identify her colors."
Negative	What Happened?: Okay, first off, I love Loving Family. I have the Twin Time and all of the accessories AND the old dolls. But when I received the new dolls as I gift, I was shocked. Mattel has completely changed the dolls from sleek to chunky. These dolls apparently look a lot like the ones they made back in the 90's. If you want dolls for your Loving Family house, try to get the old ones on eBay.
Negative	"Give us a break!: Not sure why there's such a love-fest here over this charger?? Fact is, we're talking about roughly eight bucks in parts & plastic that Canon is marking up too much. After spending so much on the camera, it's insulting to the notion of ""customer service"" that they are charging this price for a replacement charger. At least they could make it a rapid-charger enhancement or something - after all, why should it take two hours to re-charge your camera?Listen Canon, if you want five-stars from customers, treat us better, and sell replacement parts at cost. No need to take advantage of us just because we lose a part that makes our wonderful camera as useful as a stone."
Negative	"Item did not work: I was shipped what appeared to be a refurbished charger. On top of the fact this item was refurbished, it did not work. As if the upset and inconvenience of receiving a product that does not work wasn't enough, once I returned this item to sender they had the audacity to charge a ""restocking fee"". I certainly won't ever purchase from this seller ever!"
Negative	Canon Battery Charger for NB-5L Batteries: I would like to say that all of my dealings with Amazon have been wonderful, fast, and not a problem. The only reason I gave this unit a below rating is because the pictures showed a unit that just plugged into the wall, like the one that came with camera. When it arrived, I opened it up and I found a plug-in cable, then a charging box (gray), plus a battery. So I was not happy about the pictures not being the same one as I thought I had ordered, I was expecting the one with the folding prongs. Otherwise, Amazon would get a 5 on this review.
Negative	What a rip off!: I needed a charger because i misplaced mine. I an stunned they want $36 for this thing that should not cost more than $10.
Negative	inaccurate description: The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new. I got it in the mail after about 2 weeks (from Japan), and it had scratches all over it. I would not buy from this seller again.
Negative	Said it would Work.: Im going to return mine they said it would work for my Cannon Sd1000 and it didn't I wish they did more research before saying it would work. It was cheaper than buying new though but I have the hassel of sending it back.
Positive	Worked great: I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . This is the exact same one that comes with the camera , and the shipping was fast too.
Negative	Does not work: The charger does not charge my battery! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet. Rather, it has a separate cable that goes to the adapter itself and the outlet. It's junk! I am absolutely disappointed!
Positive	Perfect replacement: My original charger lost a battle with salt water, which turned it into a discharger. The replacement is exactly the same as the original, except the replacement works! My favorite pocket camera is back in business.
Positive	Cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else: I didn't want to risk a generic charger and got the Canon brand at the lowest price at Amazon.
Positive	Canon CB-2LX Battery Charger for SD800IS: It plugs into the wall, it charges the battery. What more can I say? My recommendation is keep track of the one that came with the camera so you don't have to spend the money on a second one.
Positive	Fantastic product that is pdenticle to original charger: The product works perfectly and I am extremely pleased with it. I can tell no difference between this charger and the original charger that came with my camera. Shipping was fast and professional.
Positive	Battery Charger: Purchased this item to have a second charger on hand for my new camera. Identical to the OEM at a very good price.
Positive	Exactly Like My Original: I lost my original charger and bought this to replace it and it works just like the original. Very happy about this purchase!
Positive	Cannon charger: This is a great product. I thought that I had lost the orignal(left in a hotel room)so I needed a replacement. It is the best! Found my other charger and now I have two. Great! I use the other one for the office. Great product from Cannon.
Negative	wrong item: the battery charger that I received did not have a plug. In the picture it shows a plug thatcan directly be plugged into a power outlet. The chrager did not have the plug nor a cord w/plug.I needed to use it today for a college project and had to go out and buy an additional cord.I would like to have sometone contact me about this problem.Thank you. Silvia Bryan
Positive	works like a charm: works like a charm. i had misplaced my original charger and this is a MUST to use the camera.great price and shipped in plenty of time.
Positive	Just like the one that came with the camera: Just like the one that came with the camera, works perfectly and fit the battery it says it will. Awesome.
Positive	Camera Battery Charger: I have used this product in the past with great success. I ordered more because I had misplaced my original one.
Negative	wrong item.: They shipped me CB-2LV not CB-2LX, I think a chimp that is mentally challenged could have read the label on the back of the charger and put it into the package. This is pathetic.
Positive	Buen cargador: Product very good, I am of Venezuela the exelente product thanks(Producto muy buenos, soy de venezuela el producto exelente gracias)
Negative	refused my return: I emailed the company 3 times requesting permission to return unused item and they never got back to me. I am stuck with a product I do not want that I bought by mistake. Bad business.
Positive	Regular 'ol Charger: Plain old charger that comes with the sd870is that I forgot the charger for when I went home for Christmas. Works just fine.The only thing that I can complain about is Amazon's shipping; I ordered it with 2-day shipping and since I ordered it the tracking said that it would arrive Dec. 22nd. Well, the 22nd came and went, then when I checked the tracking it said that it was on time and would arrive the 23rd. Wait, if it was on time then it would have arrived the 22nd...? OK... Thanks Amazon, so much for 2-day shipping...
Positive	It arrived. It charged. Camera works.: Somewhere out there on this Earth, there are three other equally well-made chargers I've misplaced. Until I stop losing these illusive chargers, I will continue to buy them to feed my photographic addiction.
Positive	Battery charger: My new battery charger works perfectly! I was so glad to find it for such a reasonable price! It is nice to have my camera back! Thanks Amazon!
Negative	Doesn't work: I was looking forward to using my canon powershot again as I'd misplaced my original charger while traveling. I take the charger out of the bag, not box, and plug it in only to find that it does not work - it's not charging at all. No light, no power when I put the battery back in my camera. Will ship it back very soon for a replacement or refund!
Negative	Mislead: I feel that I was mislead when purchasing this product since when I googled replacement battery chargers for my Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph, this site came up as having a compatible charger. However, when it arrived it WAS NOT COMPATIBLE!!! It cost me the postage both ways and a huge waste of time. This vendor should be more specific in advertising!! I got ripped off on this deal!!
Negative	The product never work: This is the first time I buy a product from this provider and I will never do it again, they sold me a charger without a box and that looks kind of used, when I try to charge my batteries they never did it. After a couple tries I went to a local dealer and got a brand new that made a great job in a couple hours.
Positive	Works fine: I had to buy a replacement for a camera battery. This works just fine but I do wonder why they charge such a high price for this little charger. Guess they know the camera is useless without it?
Positive	Perfect replacement for a lost charger: If you happen to misplace the factory charger, this is the exact replacement you need for the cameras listed. There were no flaws in the product, and it came in safe packaging.The only problem is cost, but I wouldn't use an aftermarket charger so I was prepared to pay for the real thing. If you lose your Canon battery charger, go ahead and order this.
Negative	"Not worth the price: Keep getting ""Driver Open Fail"" message. No solution availabe, this renders the camera unusable. Save your money."
Negative	Vivitar Should Be Cast Into the Deepest Pit of Hell: Being a camera aficionado and collector, I picked this up at Walmart to play around with. Even THAT'S not possible... see, there's no support for Mac OS X. Vivitar's website claims no driver is needed for OS X, that an icon appears on the desktop in Classic Mode. That's a cynical, damnable LIE! Until some similarly-wronged Code Warrior writes a driver for this, I can't affirm to you that the dynamic range of this sweetheart sucks eggs, but that's what I've been told.It really deserves negative stars. I used to love Vivitar SLR stuff. Now they don't even answer email inquiries and complaints. Vivitar should be cast into the deepest pit of Hell for all eternity.
Negative	Another - case of can't download pictures from camera: This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative	nonsense: Can not get the pictures off the camera. Keeps saying faliure when try to download or go to website.
Negative	I bought this as a Christmas present!: Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar!
Negative	This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???: I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM. Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for.
Positive	Janet doesn't beat Michael's Tours, but it's still amazing!: The little sister of the Jackson family has done it her brother's way. U will find her doing theatrical moves, modern dancing moves, and sexy moves. It's worth buying, because it's something u will want to watch over and over again instead of once only. so be smart and buy it cause it's worth it all!
Negative	JANET JACKSON - VELVET ROPE TOUR: Well another one of my first dvd purchases...I found this concert very poor...it did nothing for me... the sound quality was poor, The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle, Janet's performance was glitzy... but sadly something was missing...my advice is puchase Janet's later DVDS...
Negative	Fire the editor, sue the director, annihilate the producer: This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. I saw The Velvet Rope in concert and absolutely loved it! This DVD however is a disgrace to Miss Janets talents. The sound is awful and the editing even worse. All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you. Otherwise we can only hope somebody makes a re-edit and remix version so the world can finally see a worthwile version of the concert. What a shame, what a waste.
Positive	It Was A Blast: Janet Is Truly Amazing . I Went To See Her Concert Here In Johannesburg , South Africa . It Was Unbelievable . I Bought The Vhs Tape Of The Velvet Rope And Now I Am Back To Buy The Dvd Version . I Can Watch The Tape Over And Over Again . Janet Is Truly Entertaining . I Actually Did Not Expect The Concert To Be That Great , But I Would Really Stunned . The Choreography Was Really Out Of This World . I Recommend This Movie To Everybody . For 2 Hours , You Are Transformed To A World Of Magic And Excitement . I Can Guarantee That You Will Love It . Thank You Janet For Your Outstanding Performance , It Will Honestly Remain A Part Of Me For A Very Long Time ! !
Positive	The One and Only... MS. JACKSON (If you are nasty): This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet, lovers of music, and owners of quality DVDs.
Positive	beautiful representation of janet as a person: this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included.
Negative	Low quality dvd: I know I am just writing this review now but the dvd I purchased was not in good quality. I am not sure it because the actual concert was 10 to 15 year old but I did not enjoy this copy at all.thank you,Charisse Chase
Negative	"bad deal: This DVD could not be played all the way through. I tried skipping past the ""bad part"" but no dice...it simply would not play. I was really looking forward to this video and will not buy from this seller again. The only good thing was that my money was returned (less the handling fee!) Feel like I was penalized for using this seller."
Positive	what else can i say she is JANET!: this tour is like a representation of janet as a person what she feels and what she wants in life and what she is looking for and basically happiness i personally enjoy janet in everything she does because she does it so well!
Negative	"I must be the only one...: I saw this tour and the DVD was a big letdown. I thought the sound quality was poor, at best. Hollow and ""boomy"" bass are all I notice.I very much WANTED to love this video, but cannot."
Negative	Are we discussing the same DVD?: Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?
Positive	"Pure art in sight, sound and motion. JDJ as the Velvet One.: This is a highly entertaining show that you can watch over and over again. It deserves an Amazon.com double five star rating, it is that good. Think, if you will, of the Velvet One's rising to the top in spite of her talented and tabloid catching siblings and in spite of the emergence of girl groups who are flooding the airwaves and CD displays with soundalike claptrap which has only a catchy phrase or a man-slam to its merit. (Pay some dues, girls.) Look at the Velvet One's performance in the concert showstoppers--""Alright/I Get Lonely/Rope Burn"" ""Black Cat"" ""What About That"" ""Rhythm Nation""--I mean...is she great or what? And look at how many of the Velvet One's tunes you know by heart. There ain't that many performers out there of Janet's calibre at all these days...well, maybe a few of 'em. They seem to be calling themselves ""diva"". Oh well. Thanks, Velvet One, from saving us from an entertainment void."
Positive	TOO HOT TO TOUCH!: THIS CONCERT WAS SO HOT. I REGERT NOT SEEING HER WHEN SHE CAME TO HOTLANTA. WE DO HAVE THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE. WHEN I SAW IT ON HBO I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE MY PERSONAL COPY. THANKYOU JANET FOR PUTTING IT ON DVD.
Positive	MISS JANET...SHOULD I SAY MORE?!!!: I TAPED THE SHOW THE NIGHT IT AIRED WHILE IT WAS TAPING I WAS AT THE SHOW, TOO HOT, MISS JANET TORE IT UP. EVERYONE WAS SINGING WITH HER. IT WAS SO LOUD, SOMETIMES YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR IT, BUSTA WAS THERE, T-BOZ, AMONG ALOT OF CELEBS WHO WERE THERE, LISTEN, ENOUGH WITH THE TALK, JANET IS TOO FIERCE, GET THE TAPE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
Positive	it's all about the music: This concert is all about the music and art with a little bit of sex, but after this she became way too sexual in a classless way. Although janet's career is suffering right now, she will bounce back. Hey, even Velvet Rope started out slow and started picking up once Together Again was released, Damita Jo should too once the new single All Nite becomes a hit. So buy this DVD today, it's all about the music
Negative	"Do not waste your money!!: This DVD will not load in your player. You will get a message, ""this cannot be played, not a compatible format"". Hopefully Amazon.com will allow me to return this DVD. This was a bad purchase for me."
Negative	Didn't work: Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. I could only get it to play on my computer. No good.
Negative	Not one of her best...: I didn't really like it. The best part of the show to me was the intro.She seemed to never change that boring outfit. She was way too thin, and her outfits should've been tailor made as they were drooping off of her. She appeared darker, and her hair was way too long and in the way.I do see some Madonna in here, but I don't know who's copying who because they both came out around the same time. But I guess Madonna beat her to the over the top concert extravaganza's.I also saw some of the same moves that Michael did.Her most recent tour seems better than this.
Positive	Janet!!!: Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
Positive	good: The concert was her best. Great twists and turns on the concert, kept my attention most of the time.
Negative	Wack She ain't Michael: Janet Jackson works very hard.I will give her that But when she isn't biting Madonna, she is trying hard to be a 2nd tier Version of Her Brother which she will never be able to do.She can't sing& is a So-So Dancer.The Music&Production is what really has Her Name up in Lights in the First&Only Place.
Positive	"Superb: Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. ""Man of La Mancha"" has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short, heart-warming play that is, if possible, even greater than the source material.In ""Man of La Mancha"", the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is ""insanity""? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll"
Negative	Didn't even know it was a play!: Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this book is because I've heard of it before and I'm trying to read some classics.Who knew it was a play? Not me!A little hard to understand, but after I got past the introduction, I quite enjoyed the play itself. It was very funny.Not sure if you like this kind of thing, but it was just ok for me.
Negative	Not my favorite: I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. The plot is so crazy that it is hard to get a grasp on what is happening until halfway through the book. One you do figure it out, it is rather humerous, but not one of my favorites by any means.
Positive	An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists...: Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records.
Positive	Handheld slots: This is a fun little toy. My son got it this past Christmas when he was 5. When you get the winning three in a row, the machine spits out all of your change. You can put any coinage in the slot.
Negative	Such a boring toy: I purchased this slot machine thinking it was larger than it was and also hoping it would at least perform a little better than it did. It doesn't even require a coin to release the jackpot. Overall, this machine is not worth purchasing.
Negative	Immediately broke: Broke the very first time I pulled the handle. Very dissappointed, was going to give as a Christmas present. Made very cheaply, only good point was that it arrived on time.
Positive	Nobody would believe this in a novel...only true crime!!: It is hard to imagine how the three characters in this triangle came to be involved, but the author did her research well (complete with photos) and shows us how it all happened. How could this multi-millionaire make such terrible bizarre decisions? And this is a true story!
Positive	"BUDDY HOLLY ""Revealed"": I have been a Buddy Holly fan since I first heard him on the radio in my home town of Sydney, Australia.Whilst we heard all his songs, the main songs that is, it took many years, over 50, for me to be able to access a detailed visual history of his life and times and friends.It was great to see the other players who worked with him in those days eg a very young Waylon Jennings.A brilliantly put together documentary, even my wife found it very interesting! Although she got a bit sick of me falling asleep with the DVD player on and it defaulting to ""That'll be the Day"", in the early hours of the morning.A great contribution to those interested in the history and pioneers of Rock n Roll!"
Positive	Very, Very Satisfied !: I really like to Thank's for this Amazing book, well done ... this book is a beauty and fully contain a lot of informations about my beloved XBOX System ... and more ... a lot of more .... I want to say for all .... Buy this item and enjoy ! ;-)
Negative	The Black Art of Xbox mods: Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer. More details on opperating systems with the Xbox would have been helpfull. One still needs the internet and a good knowledge of where to go in order to find the rest of the puzzle.
Negative	MODDERS RUIN THE GAME!: You may think you are cool because you took the case off of your X-Box and (wow) followed a 6 step process to install your loser chip.But really you're just a cheater.Why are you playing?If you want to win games consider practice.It is a game.Once you start cheating now it's just a joke.Modding for the purpose of unlocking the xbox's media center functionality is one thing - that's fair use in my opinion, but modding to boost your rank is immature and ascinine.Why do you care what your rank is if you have such low regard for the game itself????
Negative	bad: The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Do not buy- very poor product.
Positive	Build Skills From Ground Up: Excellent DVD, Explain concepts and methods very clearly. Great DVD to have as a guide and give the practitioner of the arts lots of ideas.
Negative	bad product: i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness.
Positive	great accessory: i love this harness as it makes it so easy to cary the IM7 around. just understand that with this harness, most of the speaker and the controls on top are not protected. the purpose of this harness is to make the IM7 transportable, no to completely protect it as the bag does.
Positive	IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great!: Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!
Negative	"5 star movie , 1 star copy !! SHAME !!: i love this movie, but when i watched this dvd version of it, i thought for a moment that my tv was playing up.the sound and image are dreadfull !!!! adjusting sound and vision on tv doesn't help either, i prefer copying a video tape on dvd myself.that's not all, nowadays we expect a dvd to come with trailers, documentarys etc.. you know some extras to enjoy the whole surrounding that made the movie. here: NOTHING ! nothing at allcompare this with dvd of ""mildred pierce"" or ""straight jacket""they come with FAB extras.this dvd version is done with no effort at all."
Negative	A tresured noir given poor picture quality by KINO: The movie is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. However, the grainy gooey VHS-like picture quality can only be attributed to a very poor and shoddy transfer by KINO.
Negative	Brilliant Movie - Dreadful DVD: Kino Video ought to be embarrassed to release such a poor quality print on DVD. What everyone has said about the transfer is true. It is truly dreadful. There are better copies of this film on VHS. At one point Joan backs away from the camera in horror until her performance is nothing but a fuzzy blur.Joan Crawford's work deserves better treatment. Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film. Keep your fingers crossed.That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending. That milk! Those eyes! But why does Joan's character cry out in warning at the end of the film only to smirk pridefully as she walks away?
Positive	I'm sooo happy: I am sooo happy now that I finally have this DVD - rarely recognized fantastic film noir - Joan's best and Jack Palance's first movie break. Riveting. Arrived on time and in perfect condition!
Positive	Palaver with Palance: Perfect casting, careful pacing, and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir. Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow. Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame, and, though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock, the details are utterly jolting!
Positive	The best laid plans...: Joan Crawford chews the scenery, Jack Palance looks ugly and menacing, and Gloria Grahame slinks around in this fabulous film noir. Crawford is a wealthy socialite and playwright who marries Palance, an actor she had previously rejected from one of her plays. Turns out he has a girlfriend (Grahame) and they're plotting to murder Joan for her money. Joan finds out and decides to beat them to the punch (so to speak) by hatching a plan to murder her husband and frame his lover for the crime, complete with a little dream sequence showing the audience how it's supposed to turn out. In the middle of the plan, however, Joan loses her nerve...and that's when things get really interesting. The suspense starts about halfway through the film, when Joan discovers the plot against her, but the last ten minutes of the film dials up it a few levels. A must for any fan of Crawford and/or film noir.
Negative	Frustrated in my search: Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD. Will keep looking elsewhere for a quality transfer.Am also stymied in not being able to find a CC version. I show these wonderful old film noirs to my 92 year old Dad who is deaf; without CC, it's impossible...
Positive	Could be Crawford's Best!: Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!
Negative	Great Movie But Awful Sound Quality by KINO: This is one of those great film noir classics and Crawford gives one of her great performances. However, all of this is marred by the poor sound quality by Kino. I had to turn up the volume on my TV all the way to hear it. Crawford (in her last Oscar nominated role) and this superb film deserve much better.
Positive	Fun movie, Terrible DVD especially for the price: This movie was fun and over the top. An exciting thriller worthy of purchase, but not until the price drops. The sound is terrible. I had to crank up the volume. The picture quality is fuzzy at times. Also, there are no extra features, not even a trailer. No captions. Nothing. Bare bones. Rent it only, you won't regret this watching this.
Positive	Spine Tingling Thriller!: Joan plays Myra Hudson, a successful playrite who marries Jack Palance then discovers an awful truth....Now watch Joanie go to work in a very clever way to out fox the villians......It is no surprise to me that Miss Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for this edge of your seat Hitchcockian like thriller...It is a job very well done and Miss Crawford deserves a vivacious round of applause!! ATTA GIRL JOANIE!!!
Positive	sudden fear: i think sudden fear is a very good example of the so called films noirs and also joan crawfords performace is very convincing as the frightned woman who tries to save her life as well as she can
Positive	fun,gripping film noir: even for those of you who don't like the older films this one might grab you. good example of film noir with dramatic music, dramatic lighting and well-picked cast. the plot involves a devoted husband and a scheming husband. plot accelerates into a mind-blowing climax.
Negative	Masochist Dearest: Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance.
Negative	WARNING!!! DON'T BUY HERE CHEAP!!!! CHINA JUNK!!!: SELLER DOESN'T RESPOND BACK EITHER. WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! DON'T BUY HERE!!!! CHEAP CHINAM JUNK!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!!DON'T BUY HERE. CHEAP BOLT ON SET UP......TWISTED OFF AND BROKE THE FIRST TIME. LUCKY IT DIDN'T SMASH A FOOT OR FINGERS. LAWSUIT TIME IF IT DID.WARNING!!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!! DON'T BUY HERE. CHEAP CHINA JUNK!!!!!
Negative	Bad Product--great company. Responded immediately to problem with product.: The product was defective. Could not be cranked down. Bolts were missing from package. The company offered to replace and shipped me the missing bolts. I reccomend the company but not this jack.
Negative	Embarrassing but No Disrespect meant: I was enjoying the author's story but about a quarter of the way through I became embarrassed for her as the author is presenting a racist view point on her story. She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony. If you are that clueless to these types people using you, you need a check up from the neck up. If you want a real story; read Richard Dry's book called Leaving for a true African-American story.
Positive	Insightful: Thought this book was excellent. She has taken the time to practice some of the things that others are doing even though its not her lifestyle and she has found it to be of benefit to her.
Positive	Life Changing Memoir: I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly.
Positive	Very good reading: I had never even heard of this book. I was in the bookstore looking for The Coldest Winter Ever & it was out of stock (again). So I happened to see No Disrespect by Sr. Souljah & took a chance on reading it. I finished it in 5 days. Excellent reading, it held my attention. I recommended this book to a few of my friends.
Positive	If you value the essence of storytelling let this story...: This story weaves many of our public and private lives as African American and the sorrow and joys that we must face being the in that # that is destined to succeed in the odds against the 85%.
Negative	Offensive: I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that.
Positive	No Disrespect but...: I've been reading this book lately. It was one of the first books recommended to me as to be really good. It is pretty good and I have to admit Sister Souljah does tell it like it is and she sounds very respectful towards herself and others. Personally I think she was too goodie-goodie, though. She stays monogamous for way too long. I'm not going by other reviews either. I don't know any girl that thinks as pure as her, and I know goodie-goodie girls! But all in all, the chapters are pretty much like glue and they're realistic. The book is definitely good and I do recommend it. Especially for people who like being in touch with who they really are. I definitely want to keep reading on.
Positive	A Wake Up Call: I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others.
Negative	"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER: And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
Negative	Racist and stereotyped: I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly written) tripe. Whine, whine, whine. Take some responsibility for yourself. Bigoted, empty, hateful nonsense from a vacuous, race-baiting hack suffering a dearth of originality, an abundance of misguided vitriol, and an excess of hand-wringing and pouting disguised as legitimate literature.
Negative	"No Disrespect? - How about ""No Clue"": More nonsense about the typical knee jerk, finger pointing, resentment that takes all focus off personal responsibility. Grow up."
Positive	One of the best stories ever: I recomend this book to any young african american and women who are having problems at home and with their peers...Pick up this book...it will help alot. Wonderful book Sister Souljah
Positive	I love Sister Souljah: This book is a must read. Sister Souljah comes live and direct. Nothing sugar coated. This book is the real deal. Any black woman can probably relate to everything in this book, especially the different relationships she encounters. Go grab this book my beautiful people!
Positive	"Giggra: This is one of the best books I have ever read. I don't keep my books after I read them. If they are hardcover I donate them to the library. If they are soft cover and I can't find someone to give them too, as much as I hate to, I toss them in the trash. Which is why I now have a Kindle. I have had this book since 2000 when I read it. I LOVE this book. It was well written and I personally identified with it, being of the same generation as the author. I was inspired by the words I read. Between Morrison's The Bluest Eyes and this book....""WHEW"" is all I can say. If I had a teenage daughter I would give her this book to read just like my father gave me ""Young, Gifted, and Black"" to read. I never read the same book twice, with the exception of this book. LOVED IT!!!"
Negative	"Another boring book about oppression.......................: I must agree with the reader from Louisville. This is just another work about a black person blaming the ""white man"" for their misfortunes. This topic is so old and boring.I agree that there is a MASSIVE racial problem in this country, but do we need to be reminded of this EVERY DAY?!I've used to hear her radio talk shows in the early 1990's and must agree that she is a racist."
Negative	Whitey is oppressing you?: They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her books. Most whites in this country will never have such a luxury. Hypocrite. Racist.
Negative	Horrible Horrible...Just Go to Borders: I ordered this item on or around August 15th. It is September 13th and I have still not received this item. I emailed the shipper on numerous occasions about the item. The shipper even went as far as to lie and state that my shipping information was lost. I provided the shipper with my shipping information yet again and still did not receive the book not to mention the shipper stopped responding to my emails. Needless to say I had to file a claim with Amazon and I just went and bought the book from Borders....just buy books or whatever else this shipper is selling elsewhere...it may be more but at least you will get your item!
Negative	"No Disrespect: You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
Positive	This is a Life Changing Book!: As I read No Disrespect, I developed a new respect for Sister Souljah - for she is bright, strong, sober, calculating, and in your face, telling it like it is! I've read works of so-called prolific writers more than twice her age, yet none have touched nerves and brought revelation to me as she has in No Disrespect!I smiled to myself as I read the penetrating questions she asked the people in her life. I admire her! I wish every Black man and woman could and would read this enlightening tome, for it is a life changing adventure into a world where knowledge is king! The multitude of lessons learned are a by-product of a very entertaining read!
Positive	BADDEST BOOK I'VE READ!!!: FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT ALL TEENAGE GIRLS READ THIS BOOK. I FOUND IT TO BE VERY UPLIFTING, & LIKE EVERY DAY LIFE. MUST READ!!
Negative	this is not the way to change things.: a friend of mine had said this book was ab-soul-lutely stunning, and i'm disappointed to say it was anything but. The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book.
Negative	"I Support What She Says, But I don't believe It: I read ""No Disrespect after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found ""No Disrespect"" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent"", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."
Negative	Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.: Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is.
Negative	Not the real deal: We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them.
Positive	Close to Parallels: If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels.
Positive	Continuing the trendy radio feel,still too good!: Yeah it got a lot of radio friendly tunes but still this album is real good.Songs like the opening track,Monument & The Strand are the highlight of this album,FW never let down.
Positive	A truly beautiful recording, very personal and deep: A lot of people hate this album. I guess is because is of the softer more retrospective style. For me this album is great, far better than Paralles. As a painter and graphic artist is one of the albums a use to get in the mood to paint and create. You can find here some of the most personal and beautiful of the band's songs like, Pale fire, Shelter Me, and Island in the Stream. Plus you get one of Fates's most awesome progressive tracks- Monument. Overall an excellent production.
Positive	Fates Warning is killer.....: Fates Warning continues to push the envelope. They blend melodic riffs with bone crushing symmetry for that just right mix. This albulm is miles ahead of shades....If you like Dream Theater or Queensryche, this is a must for your collection...Its your Fate.......
Positive	Fates warning.. rule`s..: THIS ALBUM RULE`S. ALL FATE`S WARNING MUSIC IS AWESOME, THAT GUY DOWN BELOW, WHO SAID THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM HE EVER HEARD? WELL, HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN`T KNOW REAL MUSIC. {He must be a wanna be?} RAY ALDERS VOCAL RANGE`S ARE INCREDIBLE!!! MARK ZONDER AWESOME ON DRUMS.... JIM MATTEOS BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF STRINGS ... do yourself a favor buy this cd.and all the other one`s Awaken The GUARDIAN ~ my favorite all time Fate`s album NO EXIT another great one ! FATES WARNING RULES....
Negative	Disappoitment: It was first FW album I've listened to. And I'm afraid I'll never buy their CDs again. I don't want to waste my money. Well, I've heard FW is one of the prog metal monsters. Perhaps... Dream Theatre, for instance, doesn't have any such a pale album. This album has just some elements of progressive. If I have not heard it's prog rock group I'd never supposed it's progressive. Ok, the CD now is in used CD department and I hope I'll return some money.
Negative	"Sci-Fi Natural Law: Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
Positive	A Real Page Turner: Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
Positive	Take the good with the bad: Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?
Positive	Entertaining Education: A good choice for those who are not a ble to make it to birthing class, or those that want additional information. Funny, witty and covers everything from start to end.
Positive	Kim's review: These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting.
Positive	Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Don't have enough time or money for Childbirth classes? Are the classes full? Watch this video instead! Really thorough and informative. It has the same information as classes for about a tenth of the price.
Positive	I LOVED THIS VIDEO: The lady is kinda annoying. But the videos made me feel prepared and made me feel comfortable with my decision to not go to any formal classes, these were more than enough.
Positive	So helpful!: I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. I was bound and determined to do a VBAC with my second, but didn't want to redo the hospital birth classes. Got these DVDs, watched them once with my husband and several times on my own. Extremely educational, entertaining and helpful. Had a successful, drug-free VBAC and used much of the advice and information DVDs while laboring.
Positive	"pretty helpful: My husband and I both enjoyed this helpful dvd to better prepare us for the ""BIG"" day. We were not able to go to an actual birthing class because of his work schedule. There are a lot of reviews complaining about how the birthing instructor isn't very funny and somewhat cheesy, but it's really not all that bad. We both found her to actually be humorous in most parts. This dvd is very easy to understand and is great, especially for new parents like us. I def recommend it, and also, if you have netflix, you can rent it instead of buying it. But it's dvd by mail only, not instant streaming."
Negative	Hard program to watch: This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth.
Positive	Super Informative...nice alternative.: I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!
Positive	informative: I think the video was really good, im a nurse so i know most of the information already but it will hopefully help my husband. I think my husband preferred the video to an actual class. I mainly chose to use a video because of my schedule. The only thing I would have liked to see a little more was ways to help deal with the pain- like more breathing techniques. Overall I think it was good and would reccomend it.
Negative	Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!: This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff.
Negative	Don't waste your money: I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her.
Negative	not worth the money: i felt like i was being talked down to the whole time. Me and my wife found this video to be a waste of money. The women in the video seem uninterested with what was going on and the video as a whole felt very out of date. Do not waste your time with this video.
Negative	Long winded.: This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you.
Negative	"Way too annoying: I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her ""funny stories"". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear."
Negative	"Spare yourself from this: Turns out Sheri is the most annoying person ever. And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole ""pushing"" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."
Negative	Take the time and go to the casses: This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary. Also some of the information in this video is out of date. Go to the classes offered at your hospital. The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees.
Positive	its great: was helpful, it comes down all the nerves that exist before having the baby, enjoyed, did not get bored, its interesting and you feel like your part of the class. thanks
Positive	Very informative!: My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting.
Positive	great alternative to going to a class: My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)
Negative	Just ok: The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch.
Positive	Great Video!: I really didn't want to take Lamaze classes, just not my thing. So I researched DVD's and found the Laugh and Learn Series. This is an excellent teaching and exceeded my expectations. Very helpful, detailed and well layed out video. I watched it once and the second time I watched it I took notes. I maye even watch it one more time before my baby is born this July.
Positive	Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy: Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well.
Positive	Daughter loved it!: I purchased this for my daughter, expecting her 1st child. She loved it! Tons of information in a FUN way! Very enjoyable and informative.
Positive	Really Corny but Lots of useful info.: Title about sums it up. If you know diddly squat about your wife being pregnant, worth the watch. Probably could find all the info on Wikipedia or something though. I felt it was worth it.
Positive	Very educational: This DVD has good information, but the woman is annoying. I think they could have shortened it up a little bit. It is a good alternative to going to a birthing class.
Positive	Great for 1st Time Parents: My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. We can always refer back to it if we need a refresher course. The breathing technique and education was on point.
Positive	Worth it: My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. We decided on this one, and although the 'teacher' was a bit corny it was helpful. I especially liked that you could fast forward and skip parts! All in all it was a worthwhile purchase and proved helpful to us both.
Negative	Take a class: Don't waste your money. If she had been my instructor I would have asked for my money back
Positive	"Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is ""taught"" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!"
Negative	Lackluster, Uninformative DVD: The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. The visual aides, diagrams, etc. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner. The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation.
Negative	There is no laughing in this video...: There's not much learning either. Sheri is incredibly condescending when she mimicks pregnant women. This video could also really use some visual aids besides Sheri holding up a poor illustration, writing lists (that she doesn't finish) on a whiteboard and the worst...her on the ground, legs spread in high-waisted khakis demonstrating childbirth.
Negative	Because I love condescension: If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it's condescension. I can't stand being talked down to.There are much better videos out there that treat the viewer as if they are an adult.
Negative	Ruined my life..: I'm an expected father to be, and I thought this DVD would help me show my caring compassionate side... I was trying to be part of the whole child birthing process. Thing is, this DVD provoked an unearthly rage in my spouse. While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information. My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. The information she did give is easily obtainable from a free pamphlet. When I told my spouse I paid $[...] for the movie she freaked! [...]
Negative	Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!: Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused.
Negative	The most annyoying childbirth video....ever!!!: You could not pick a more annoying instructor than Sheir Bayles. She absolutely ruins this class. The video quality is horrible as are the 80's rejects posing as her audience. My wife (a physician) and I cringed through the entire presentation.If you buy this video after reading my review, you deserve to lose your money AND be subjected to Sheri Bayles for over 5 grueling hours.
Positive	Don't go into labour without watching this class!: The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way..
Positive	A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I bought this DVD trying to avoid taking a Lamaze class and it totally did the trick. I felt better informed and prepared for natural child birth and how to avoid unnecessary interventions. I recommend this for any new or repeat Mommy's.
Negative	Missing tons of crucial elements: This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge.
Negative	annoying instructor- waste of time: I wish I could give this video 0 stars. Don't waste your money on this video. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny. She is not funny. The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) Also, the footage appears to be from the mid 1990's- very dated, it's like watching a VHS recording. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this- you'll see.
Negative	blagh: I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!
Positive	Lots of Good Information: I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. I am so glad I purchased this video. The price is very good for the information received.Updated 30 Nov 10 :This video was a life saver. The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery. Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative.
Positive	Excellent: Our baby is here, and the DVDs prepared us very well for what was in store. We knew what questions to ask, and what the nurses/doctors meant when they were using their vernacular thanks to these classes. This is a great substitute for the classes at the hospital because you get the same information at a fraction of the cost.
Positive	It gets the job done: My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn't have worked. I figured the next best idea (and actually cheaper idea) was to get a DVD we could both watch. Sheri Bayle's attempt at humor is not as good as she would probably have hoped but she is still an informative and relaxing teacher. I would recommend this DVD if you can't attend a class or if you just need to save a little money for all the stuff you will need to buy your new baby!
Positive	very informative: I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I found this to be just what I needed. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time. I like the fact that I can go back and review parts of it whenever I want. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have.
Positive	Better than taking a class!: This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!
Negative	"Annoying and condescending: My husband and I couldn't fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, ""laugh and learn"" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever."
Positive	She gets funny, annoying... but you learn in the end.: I read other reviews before buying this DVD and I was aware of what to expect. I think you will learn from this DVD everything you need to know for labor. Husbands can also have fun with this video. If you dont mind the jokes and silly faces she makes then buy it. The best part is that you can re play the video again and again.
Positive	Excellent: I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!
Negative	Whiny. Annoying. Can't watch. Not funny.: Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch. I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth.
Positive	Wonderful: This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. I watched this before my son was born, and had a completely natural birth because of it. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital. The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here!
Positive	Invaluable Resource!: Sherry's a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. We loved this video and learned so much.
Positive	Fantastic if you can't make a live childbirth class: We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. This DVD was absolutely fantastic for us. It is packed full of useful information and actually quite entertaining. I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class.
Positive	"could have done without the ""laugh"": very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared ""comedian"" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. it was painful. this made me glad that i didn't attend a childbirth class (and bought this instead).i also could have done without the Viacord plug... it's like a commercial took over the ending of the program to spoil it.all things considered, definitely worth watching."
Positive	Current and easygoing class on childbirth.: My husband and I decided to buy this when we had to miss the childbirth class we had signed up for at the hospital. It was easy to watch, very informative and we appreciated the up-to-date information on labor and childbirth. I would recommend it to any pregnant women/couples out there looking for a cheaper and more relaxed childbirth class.
Positive	Better than actual class!: My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. It was very outdated. This DVD was great - very current. Yes, some of her jokes were lame and her attempting to be funny gets a little old, but overall it was really a beneficial DVD. It was nice to be able to do it at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home. I would definitely recommend this DVD to expectant parents rather than taking an actual class.
Positive	Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule: This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don't have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. We were able to do these classes out of the comfort of our own home, on our time and without the frustration of traffic, etc. Also, the DVD was less money than what the hospital wanted to charge us for enrollment into their classes. The sound fluctuates a bit, but it did not get in the way of our learning experience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone out there!
Negative	Disappointed: I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price.
Positive	Good video, not as cheesy as people say: I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be.
Positive	Verry happy with this video - 1st time mom here: I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. I don't have time to take a class so I bought this video. I am soooo happy I did! I have learned sooo much and feel very confident now about what to expect at the labor. Sherri Bayles is funny and explains things very very well. I highly recommend this video.
Positive	Very Educational and Informative: My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us. We loved being able to watch this DVD at our leisure in the privacy of our own home. This was one of two DVD's that we purchased and this one was by far the best. Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. I'll certainly keep this one and watch it for subsequent pregnancies.
Positive	This DVD really helped me: My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. They said it must have been good because I did everything perfectly. I would highly recommend this DVD!
Negative	Who's laughing?: My husband and I are expecting our first baby any day now. We opted to get a childbirth video versus attending a class. After doing some research and getting reccomendations from friends, I decided to purchase this video. While the information on the DVD is helpful and each segment is clear and easy to understand, the instructor presented it in such a way that made extremely painful to watch.The instructor continuously makes annoying jokes, mocks pregnant women and their partners, using the most unfunny and unflattering impersonations imaginable. Watching this woman's attempt stand-up routine was so uncomfortable that we often found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of it. Please believe that neither me or my husband laughed during this DVD. Not once.I wish we had just gone to childbirth class.
Positive	Very Helpful...........!: I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.
Positive	Great Purchase! Worth it!: My husband and I did not want to have to take the time or money to attend an actual birthing class. We decided to purchase this video and we are very pleased with the product. The video goes over everything you will need to know. It is very informative. My husband loves the way that Sheri Bayles teaches about child birth. He thinks she is funny. Defiantly recommend this video.
Positive	All I needed to know...: I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video.
Positive	Great knowledge for a new mommy or experienced mother: I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions . This is the best you can get to attending a class yourself. I felt engaged and involved in the class just by watching it on the Television. It covers everything that you need to know about childbirth and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go!
Positive	"Comprehensive and fun: Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Plus, she is just plain funny. The video is divided into six ""classes"" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting. I highly recommend the set!"
Positive	Must have!: This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth...your birthing class may not explain things with this much clarity and detail (I know my didn't). I learned a lot about breathing, and controlling your breath, and although I am not planning on using drugs through labor, I thought her section on medical interventions very useful.
Positive	good information, but...: A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)
Negative	Rudimentary, though a tad insightful: It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though.
Negative	Are you kidding me?: First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse.
Negative	poor choice!: Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear! Look elsewhere for your information and make sure to read Ina mAY gASKIN'S GUIDE TO CHILDBIRTH!
Negative	Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy: Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
Positive	Great information: I wasn't able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. I fully intend to use the breathing techniques and I learned a lot of information about labor and delivery. I really like I could go at my own pace and watch and re-watch any parts I needed.
Positive	Great for calming first child fears: I felt completely in the dark about what to expect when my wife was pregnant.... I like being in control of my situations and knowing the right things to pay attention to, I was concerned about my lack of knowledge especially since we were giving birth in Hong Kong and I was worried about a possible language barrier.This DVD made me a self-proclaimed expert.. I really felt like I knew everything I needed to know and it completely dispelled all my worries.When it came to the big day... despite complications such as water breaking with no signs of labor, introduction of a drug to induce labor, and the ultimate required c-section, I never broke a sweat. I even helped with some decisions, like how long we were going to wait until we gave up on a natural birth. My wife didn't watch this DVD with me, but I was able to comfort her through the whole process by telling her what to expect next.This is an ABSOLUTE no question about it MUST for a new parent-to-be.
Positive	"BEST Childbirth DVDs ever: These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. Some people criticize that, but I'm quirky...so maybe that's why I like it. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. I'm very much of the mindset that ""if I need meds, I'll scream for them."" From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes. But really, even my husband LOVES watching this DVD!"
Positive	helpful: This dvd was very helpful before I had my first baby. I wanted to be aware of the different things to do and what my husband should expect and it gave lots of information. loved it!
Positive	laugh and learn about childbirth: Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
Negative	not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband: I will give her I did learn something while I wasn't being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. After weeding through, rolling my eyes and totally annoyed by this person, I did find out something. There was NO LAUGHING though. I found her unsympathetic unattached to the really beautiful thing that will be happening when I give birth. Just when I wasn't scared anymore after reading Ina Mae's guide to Childbirth, this woman made me feel aweful about the impending doom that awaits me. I am saposed to be scared and my husband an unhelpful weenie who can't deal, how can this women do this to the world when we've come so far. Unrelaxing and totally neurotic!! A huge waste of money and time. Don't buy it, I wish I hadn't. Really.
Negative	Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps: me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD.
Positive	Super Cute Toy: So glad they brought back this classic toy. My 4 year old daughter hasnt put it down. She was so excited to get 4 puppies!!
Negative	useless: i was very excited when I saw the ad. I planned to buy a few of macro lenses, but ...the macro lens works only for the 1/4 inch distance :-(I cannot scan a business card or an article in a newspaper, but only a few charactersI really need a macro lens but for a few inches distance
Negative	very bad quality!!!!!: This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!
Negative	WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL: This film lacks all the elements that make Argento's movies great and fun to watch. There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project.
Negative	The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!: I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
Negative	Why an EP release of this film?: While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode.
Negative	The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!: I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray.
Negative	Slow and pointless: Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it.
Negative	"Really, really bad: Argento used to be one of Italy's best film makers, unfortunately with ""Trauma"", this and ""Phantom of the Opera"" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying"
Positive	Late masterpiece by a brilliant director: The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock. On the one hand it offers you all you ever liked about Argento's flicks: beautiful images, a brilliant soundtrack (this time by Ennio Morricone), ingenious camera working, bloody killings and breathtaking locations. Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro...
Negative	the worst picture quality i saw since old rental vhs: Previous review is right. Horrible! Nothing else to say about this blu-ray transfert.I cannot even write anything about the movie itself: I have not seen it! Yes after 10 minutes I could not stand such a bad transfert anymore and I stopped watching it!!
Negative	Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie: Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.
Positive	The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition): Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her track leads her to the Uffizi museum in Florence. There however, Anna is struck by the Stendhal Syndrome, which makes her faint, when among certain works of art, like paintings and statues. Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario..........
Negative	Horrible blu-ray transfer!: This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Maybe the worst I've seen so far. I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic. I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative). So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did. Just stick with the DVD. And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann).
Negative	"Very Bad transfer...: The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more ""transfers"" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma ""studios"" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie? Who knows...you can barely see it. If Troma gets its hands on the great ""Suspiria"" there is no God."
Negative	DONT BUY TROMA RELEASE: The Troma release is horrible, do not buy it. If you want a good release of this film, buy the Blue Undergroud disc...it is more than worth the extra money.The picture and audio quality on the Troma disc is terrible, and the introduction by Lloyd Kaufman is one of the most annoying things I've ever seen. It's a shame that Troma ever got their hands on such a great film.
Positive	You will be freaked: This is one of the best Argento Movies ever. The music though simple stays with you. There are few plot holes unlike most Agrento Moives. The ending is a definite twist! I hope Troma releases the UNCUT version of Stendhal Syndrome because there really is no place to cut the movie without losing some of the impact and Plot points
Negative	Terrible DVD of an impressive film: The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice.
Negative	Watch out!: I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out. They felt fine but I couldn't even take two (out of three) doses of the pill in one day. This stuff made me feel really nauseas, queezy, and a bit disoriented and restless - which I attribute to the caffeine in this product because I can barely drink one cup of coffee without feeling kind of weird.I never thought diet pills were the solution, and this product just confirms that. I strongly recommend working on the internal issues as to why you can't loose the weight instead of searching for shortcuts.
Negative	video player: I really wanted to play the bingo game, however, the CD's did not play. I tried to play other games, to no avail.
Positive	Liked it: I think Izzy is very talented and I'm glad he's using his talent for Kingdom music. I didn't always feel like he gave his all in every song but the lyrics were great and a few songs really caught my ear. I can't say that it's my favorite cd, but I think it's a great way to round out any Christian's cd collection. I hope to see more from this artist.
Positive	An important addition to the mushroom breeder's library.: This book is oriented toward those interested in developing improved strains of edible mushroom species. Highlighted species include Flammulina velutipes (enokitake), Lentinula edodes (shiitake), Agaricus bisporus (common white button, portabella, crimini), Coprinus cinereus (woolly inky cap) among others. Caution, this is not a how-to-grow book, but a technical reference for breeders. Reviewed by THE MUSHROOM GROWERS' NEWSLETTER, April 1993 issue.
Positive	Great book for puzzled entrepeneurs!: I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this book was used as our text-book. I found it to be very informative and easy to read. The section concerning Business Plan development was very helpful. I recomend this book to anyone trying to find their way through the myrad of information available when starting a small business. The book is very down to earth, in every chapter there are at least 2 real world examples or case studies for the student to compare to his or own experience
Positive	Great Buy: This book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Even after paying for express shipping we saved over $120 from the bookstore cost.Thanks Amazon!
Negative	terrible shipping service: it took a month to get the book in spite of numerous emails and no feedback about the urgency. I finished the summer school without the book.Don't buy anything from this seller.
Positive	Must read for anyone interested in the A-bomb decision: Mr. Maddox has done a great service in analyzing the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan. He systematically demolishes the arguements used by those who (for whatever reason) think that the bombing was unjustified. He shows through intercepted transmissions how the Japanese were ready to commit themselves to a bloodbath to fight off an invasion and how the Japanese military still wanted to fight even after Hiroshima was destroyed. Overall, the book is great work and should be required reading in schools and the Smithsonian Museum.
Negative	Disappointed: I bought this book, because I thought I will get some new insights on the big money lotteries, but I do not think there is anything of value there. I have the older book of Gail Howard; used to play Fantasy 5; 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 are the highest prizes I have ever won. Do not get caught by the hype: This book won't tell you how to win the big money lotteries - in fact, all that Gail Howard says is that it's very difficult to predict the Powerball ball, and the Powerball ball cannot be wheeled anyway. Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere. The book has a very long section (some 20+ pages) of ads about Howard's other books and software. Hey, you pay for that too! You'd be better off spending your $$ on a couple of extra tickets...
Negative	Nothing New: This is nothing new from Gail Howard, or at all. These wheeling systems can be worked out mathematically, without paying for this book. There are also lots of websites that offer number generators and wheeling system explanations for free. If you want it all spelled out for you then buy this book, but if you are willing to do a little mathematical work check out lottery information website like [...].
Negative	Not Very Useful Unless You Can Afford to Spend A Lot of Money, Buying a Lot of Tickets Per Game...: I found her concept very, VERY good, BUT, unless you're really flush and can afford to spend a great deal of money for a LOT of number combinations per game, it certainly doesn't increase your odds much. Now... there ARE folks who can afford, and DO buy, many ticket combinations per game... so for THEM this may be helpful; however, for the average person who buys only a few number combinations each game, this is a waste of time. Sorry Gail :o( !!
Negative	Waste oF $MONEY$: Waste Of Time & Money... I found that if you want to win big, just put the money into a savings account & watch your money grow! Pay YOURSELF not this author.
Negative	The odds are against you not for you.: Winning is pure luck. There is no amount of strategy unless you are already rich. And believe it or not rich people play too. They can buy 100 tickets week. I cannot. But in reality it only takes ONE set of numbers to win anyway.Gail conviently leaves out this one very fact. 71% of winners are quick picks. The rest here and there over the years have been their own numbers. You cannot predict the powerball.The book has good ideas but how many people have won by using some kind of random system? I doubt any. It is all luck, pure and simple.
Negative	Incorrect Product Information: The actual model of this meter is the i410, I am unsure where the number 617727 is relevant as Fluke doesn't identify it with this number. I suspect this is a component of some kit, which is defunct and therefore the reason for the strange model number. There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns. If someone purchased this and did not return it, maybe AMAZON did not look at the listing.I suggest those looking for a current probe visit the link in this review and proceed from there. The review is for the improper listing.
Negative	DO NOT AGREE: THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE Fluke 617727 Clamp-on Current Probe INDICATES CLEAR GOOD THAT: Fluke Clamp-on Current Probe is to 1000 amp AC/DC current clamp for ideal DMMs and is the digital tool to extend the current ranges of multimeters. THEY SENT ME THE MODEL I410 WHO IS GIVES 400 AMP OF RANGE, NOT THE ONE THAT BUYS THAT SUPPOSEDLY IT(HE,SHE) IS GIVES 1000 AMP OF RANGE, I FEEL DEFRAUDED BECAUSE I PAID FOR A Clamp-on Current Probe GIVE MORE CAPACITY AND THEY GAVE TO ME ONE OF MINOR CAPACITY.
Negative	Misguided and unclear product info: I bought this clamp and it turns out I need digital multimeter to operate it. I do not understand DMMs means before . After i received it and read the intruction then I understood. I wished that the ad could be more clearer. I have not returned it yet because it cost money to send it back.Any suggestion ? Mean a while I already bought another fluke amp meter that does not need another digital meter to operate it.
Negative	wrong amp rating on website: The Fluke current clamp works properly but the Amazon website listed the device as having 1000amp capacity. Actual specification is only 400 amps. Since I'm monitoring an 800 amp, AC service it's not too helpful. Please fix the website. Product description as of 05/06/12 says 1000amp AC/DC.In the technical details it would be very, very helpful if you would attach pdf's of the manuals and spec sheets.
Negative	Might as well buy it at the apple website: It's $39.00 on the apple website, there is free shipping as well, so why buy it on amazon? I came here looking for a deal and was disappointed.
Positive	Apple travel plugs well made: I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need.
Positive	Flawless: Worked like a charm all over England. I haven't tried the other adaptors, but I found my MacBook to work just like it does here in the US, and there was no difficulty plugging into the outlets.
Negative	"I don't get it: Why does everyone rave about this? One of the reviews even says, ""If you need this then get it."" Yeah, if you're travelling you need this, but more importantly why can't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook? Another apple rip-off if you ask me."
Negative	"This is a Joke: When travelling I seek to minimise the weight and number of items I bring. Technology is one good place where gains on this front can be made. This product bundle is a complete joke. Why so many pieces? Why bring all of that excess stuff? If the answer is ""just take the ones you will need for a given trip"" then why not just buy some cheapo country/ region specific solution? If you are serious about travel with your electronics (not just Apple) check out this:Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter. It has covered me in Asia, Australia, and Europe and there is only one piece to deal with."
Positive	Hail Mary!: This album is truely amazing. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are funny yet full of truth, and her voice is awsome. The songs are full of crude humor as she talks extensively about drinking and sex. Somehow though, even a more conservative girl like me can grow to loooove her music. The reason is because of how deep her lyrics can be, even though, at a first lisen, it might not appear that way. Her songs can range from very funny like, The World is Full of Bastards, which almost any girl can relate to, and guys laugh about, and Mata Hari, about a fake and slutty girl to more somber like Takes His Place, about relationships never working out. Her songs speak to everyone as she speaks about messing up in life and about bad relationships. Everyone needs to get this cd, support lil local bands...also see her in concert, that is the most amazing experience!
Positive	More dirty lyrics....but it's great!: Mary Prankster may offend the meek...but they can go elsewhere, 'cause Mary scores another hit. It's great!
Positive	roulette girl: After listening to Mary's first release, Blue Skies Over Dundalk, I thought it couldn't get any better than that. Well, Mary has proven me wrong. Roulette Girl is a half hour of deeply emotional yet still witty songs. Anyone with a pulse should own this album.
Negative	Size way too big: This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping.
Positive	Newman is a musician worth listening to.: As a sensitive person with eclectic tastes it's easy to be impressed by Animal Dreams. It's full of original, creative surprises that restore faith in the existence of musicians courageous enough to speak with their own voice, from something deeper and broader than a desire for popularity. You can't find this CD at the music store nearest you but fortunately it's available here. I recommend Animal Dreams and Ron Newman as a musician worth listening to.
Negative	single song makes it worth it: Almond sings off-key, but that is a longstanding trademark , and, oddly, creates a weird appeal regarding his singing style. The songs however are a combination of irritating and boring, with the notable exception of his duet with Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. Their mutual effort is a winner and, if unavailable on other discs, makes this disc worth having.
Positive	Very Helpfull: Excellent little book, specially for some of as, that came to this country a bit later in life, and need it to learn the language just like everyone that comes here.
Positive	Good: Remembering my school and college days. reminds the grammar lessons and explaining the rudimentary parts of speech noun, verb, pronoun, adjective, adverb
Positive	Great Book!: Great book for people that need to write email. It would be nice to review the grammar rule's from time to time.
Positive	A very clear picture of the English language: I enjoyed reading this and brushing up on my grammar. I thing I whould have done better at school if I had this then.
Negative	"Old and free is no way to sell your books, son.: If you need a grammar reference, this may well serve until you find a better one. It might be of greater utility if the tone wasn't vaguely condescending and pedantic, and it eschews the panoply of actual examples in favor of definitions. To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of ""to love"" results in ""If you have been loved..."" gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate ""falar"" and need to know which one to use.--#"
Positive	Beautiful Hard Cover: Very Slick Looking Book - Perfect Condition and Glossy Looking - Looking forward to reading it :)
Negative	"If the title is incorrect...: If you REALLY want to write correct, you won't write ""correctly."" Yes, it's in common use but it is, by the rules of grammar, incorrect. It's an overcorrection, an unnecessary addition. Here's a simple rule of thumb: Substitute the word ""fast"" where you're thinking of adding an -ly. Would you say ""How to Speak and Write Fastly?"" No. Same part of speech, but it somehow escaped that stupid -ly trap."
Positive	Effective: I found the information timeless. Yes, somethings sounded dated because of time. Yet it did not take away from the content.
Positive	Very helpful!!: Very nice book! I am very happy with all the information on this book. It explains a lot of english grammar!
Positive	Excellent Work: Great book. Really helpful and easy to follow. I know it will come in handy because I am not the best at speaking or writing.Thank you!
Negative	Too Much Info: This book should have been written more as a novel than a how to. This book goes into story like dimensions and there are others better written on the subject.
Negative	This is a gem, for a CERTAIN KIND of reader: If you know it all already, this is a good book for you to buy. If you are looking for grammar instruction, look elsewhere. This little book was written 75 years ago and it has things worth thinking about, but it is not a grammar book, or a book on speaking, or a book on writing. I just bought it and am delighted to rummage about in it. It's a GEM. It's worth the money by a mile and a half. I gave it two stars only to not be lost in the shuffle. Buyers often don't look at 50 rave shill reviews but they'll look to see who doesn't like and why. So maybe I caught some readers. This is a good buy IF you KNOW IT ALL. It's not instruction, it's food for thought.
Negative	"This book is awful. Give it a miss.: Even for the free Kindle version, I found myself thinking, ""I want my money back!""This book is a laundry list of rules and regulations of writing, grammar and style that are incredibly outdated. And how can you trust a language coach who, in his effort to teach us to write clearly and using simple words, writes, ""This book has no pretension about it whatever, -- it is neither a Manual of Rhetoric, expatiating on the dogmas of style...""Expatiating, indeed. lolThere are countless books out there that will help you improve your writing and knowledge of the English language. This definitely isn't one of them!"
Negative	no dice: This is a book that serves no purpose i would not read again it does not do wat the title says it is
Positive	books: free from amazon, downloaded the free kindle app for a new android phone and was trying it out, have not read the book yet but the pages and quality look good.
Positive	Smooth Feel but costly: I loved the product, but when I went back to get another bottle, I discovered it had nearly doubled in price....so no thanks...I'll find something else.
Negative	I have not received the item: I have not received the item that I bought. I amjust waiting for some extra days in order to send a claim or a complain.Rgrds,Xavier Arderiu
Positive	Good raw thrash...: I've never been a huge fan of Voivod, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Very raw and over-the-top, with raspy vocals and plenty of energy. I'll definitely be checking out some of their other stuff as well, as this one is really growing on me...
Positive	"NUCLEAR WAR!: A must-have for any fan of Thrash Metal. Blacky's meat-grinding bass sound and Snake's Venom-like vocals will make you wish you were born a Voivodian. However, the production sounds somewhat inadequate. Having seen Voivod live this past summer perform two of these tracks (""Nuclear War"" and ""Voivod""), I thought they sounded MUCH better in concert than on the album. Still, it's WAR & PAIN!"
Positive	pure hardcore thrash: If you want a pure hardcore 80's thrash sound then this cd is for you.It sound like they locked the producer out of the studio and then recorded. It's pure, raw, agressive and (for the time when it came out) nasty.The fore-runners of the 80's thrash scean. Taking the best from both the thrash and punk genra. Unfortunate for all that they didn't recieve the recomendation that they deserved.
Positive	Fabulous!!: I think this album is brilliant--awesome music!! Can't turn it off!!! Especially love Allegratango!!! Adiemus could sing to the sound of a washing machine and still sound good! Kudos!!!
Positive	Masterpiece.: Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection.
Positive	"Not as good as ""What burns never returns""...: ...but a very good pick anyway! As usual Don Caballero manage to hover miles above the average indie-record. This time tough the music is less aggressive, the drumming less furious and the pace is overall calmer. Don't get me wrong, they haven't limped, they still spark with energy and creativity, only the've become more ""mature"". For those who don't know anything about the band I'll just say that they find themselves between shellac and tortoise, between arty improvisation (which most people call post-rock) and noise-rock."
Negative	"Two Words: Terrible ""Author"": Great book if you want to read the self-indulgent ramblings of delusional, holier-than-thou person with an 80 at best IQ. NOT recommended."
Positive	Great Band Info: I was born in 67. So I have always enjoyed 70 s music but found alot of great music from the 60's about 5 years ago. I play guitar and that always gave me reasons to learn more.
Positive	Story of The YARDBIRDS: Excellant DVD. Had a lot of info I didn't know about the band. Highly recommended.
Positive	Usher: OMG Tour Live From London [Blu-ray]: The DVD was amazing.. My whole family watched, we love Usher..This was better than going..I could see his every move.Thank you Amazon you make shopping easy..
Positive	If you love Usher, you want!: I wasn't totally in love with the show, but I'm an Usher fan. I feel like the Los Angeles show would have been more banging! I've been dying for Usher to release some sort of concert on Blu-ray. Really wish Confessions or 8701 would get put on Blu-ray. If you are a real Usher fan, this is a must have!
Negative	Terrible: I bought thnking was another artist, but anyway when I watch it , how bad this guy sing, very bad, no voice, it is terrible show, terrible sound. Not worth it at all
Positive	Usher's Concert: If you a fan of Usher this blue ray concert is a must have. The quality and his performances are very good.
Positive	Frasier: A great DVD by Usher; I love his music. The perfromances are great and the songs make you want watch the DVD over and over again. I recommend that you buy this one.
Positive	An 80's classic!: I don't know what it is about this movie but it's a classic 80's flick! Mark Harmon is at his best. The plot is a little predictable but it's entertaining and takes you back to the decade past.
Negative	Not good, not bad: If you like early Mark Harmon, then it is worth the time. Otherwise, it is a made for TV style situation comedy. There are some embarrassing moments and a heart-warming ending.
Positive	A great and fun romantic comedy that is not very well known: This is an old school comedy and it is not very well known, but it is a real cute and funny movie, with some wonderful actors doing a great job, a great storyline, and for all the guys some really pretty girls! ;) It is a really great romantic comedy that I highly recomend to anyone who likes this genre!! Out of 5 stars I give it 4 and 1/2.
Negative	Whoops! Product description does not mention it is incomplete: I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.
Negative	Looks like it was Printed on a cheap broken down Printer: Ok.. I Love the story.. it is a beautiful romance .. I read it on-line and I wanted my own copy for that cold rainy night get-away. when It arrived I couldn't wait to open it. just to touch the words.. and then Put it in my bookshelf for a perfect night.... WHAT A SHOCK when I opened it to see the POOR PRINTING JOB ... on some of the pages even the lines are askew. black blotches around the words in some cases. and choppy letters not even fully formed on others... WHAT A VAST DISSAPOINTMENT. SHAME ON AMAZON!
Positive	Great for kids who like to work with their hands...: This kept my grandson busy for a long time and they are very durable. He made many different things with them.
Negative	What ever happened to Barbara Crampton?: In Movieland, some people are just born for certain parts. This was a Jeffrey Combs/Barbara Crampton movie if there ever was one. All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time. Oh, and Joe Estavez...Talk about unintentionally hilarious!!!.
Positive	One of the best....: What a rib tickler this film is...I've seen it twice and know that twice more at least is on the cards. Of course, I love Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu, so to have them together is pure heaven! For a quite amazing contrast, check out 36 Quai des Orfèvres, a violent police/crime drama also starring both actors. Whether you speak French or not, you can tell these guys aren't just playing themselves...they are both excellent actors. See these films if you're a real, dyed-in-the-wool film buff!
Negative	Fourth order of the same movie.: I have ordered this DVD four times. Picture is fine, music is fine, subtitles are fine BUT none of the received DVD has french dialogs/ actors' voices. Does somebody else have the same experience??Steve
Negative	Offensive: This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen. Don't let the title or the box fool you. Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment. I was shocked that such a film could come out of France. If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.HIDEOUS!
Negative	Nothing to Write Home About: Nice in theory, but doesn't really do the trick. We thought the longer shaft and small profile would make it easy to hold it in the right spot during intercourse to give me the extra zing necessary. The problem is, the surface is difficult to press up against the right spot. If the paddle had a nub on it or it was convex would make it a lot better.I was also disappointed in the speed/strength. In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase. The strength is a little much to start off, and usually not enough after a short while. It would be nice if the power were adjustable.Positive: Very easy to clean - waterproof - inexpensive - slender design makes it easy to bring with you anywhere.
Positive	A book by an outstanding mentor: Dr. Jeanne Shaw is an outstanding mentor and guide in the area of human relations and relationships, as reflected in her handbooks. From her decades of experience of counseling individuals and couples come the vital lessons that she has compacted into this handbook.I have learned so much not only about relationships, but about life and living from Dr. Shaw, that I remain eternally indebted to her.
Positive	xinhua dictionary chinese / english translation: i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book.
Positive	Life Drawing: Techniques in Action: I teach Figure Drawing and I am using some of the exercises with my class. They love the new way of thinking. Guessing measurements has really helped.
Positive	Why is Amazon still out of stock? This is a great item?: I liked Ms Woods book on life drawing (which I bought through Amazon) so when I saw a DVD also listed, I was interested. Amazon listed it out of stock, but I managed to find a copy. I am amazed to see months later that you still show it out of stock. It is an excellent DVD. I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point. I found many of her 'lessons' helpful and would think many Amazon clients would agree. Incidentally, her book that piqued my interest wasLife Drawing: A Journey to Self-Expression
Positive	Excellent Product, Fast Shipping: Scott's Cakes contacted me after receiving my previous order. Representative was pleasant, and wanted to know how they could improve. They did what was recommended and my next shipment came on time and without melted chocolate!!!Thank you Scott's Cakes for providing my family with delicious products and excellent customer service!!!
Negative	Foam Ripoff: The most uncomfortable, overpriced piece of foam on the market. Also beware that there is a 10 day return policy on this piece of junk.
Positive	It really helped me: I had very bad hoarseness from acid reflux. Prescription medicine wasn't helping. My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux.
Positive	Eliminated my acid reflux: My acid reflux started a year ago. Whenever I lied down, my esophagus would start hurting within minutes. I tried just about all of the various acid reducing pills, both prescription and non-prescription as well as many natural remedies, with limited effect. I still woke up every hour or two at night and had to chew antacids to be able to sleep the next hour.After using this pillow for a few days my acid reflux pain disappeared and I don't need medication anymore. I place the back support pillow along the lower edge of the wedge pillow, inside the pillowcase, to elevate my rib cage. I use the neck support pillow together with a regular pillow, inside a pillowcase, to support my neck. I try to sleep as much as possible on my left side, although after a couple of weeks there was no discomfort sleeping either on my back or on my right side.
Positive	Clan of the Cave Bear: I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla.
Positive	A really good book: Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone.
Positive	It's a good book: This is the first in a series of very good books following the life of a prehistoric woman. She uses creativity intelligence to live in a difficult environment.
Negative	Typos abound: I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will.
Positive	I'm going nuts!: PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!
Positive	Well researched, educational, and realistic!: An inspiring depiction of a woman. I received this from my mother in Junior High School, I only read this recently. I wish I had read it sooner. I have sent this series to all my friends. I can't wait for the next book!
Positive	Enthralling: I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow
Negative	Tedious: This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended.
Negative	Prehistory - Schmistory: Intellectually and artistically roughly on a par with the Flintstones. Despite the numerous five star reviews it has received here this risible prehistoric bonkbuster is utter dross, a hopelessly 'eighties modernist' take on the past diplaying minimal knowledge of human nature and the way new ideas and societies really evolve.Of course good fairy tales can be entertaining for children and adults alike and are an esential part of our cultural heritage. Not this one though
Negative	Great Title Not a great narrator: I found Sandra Burr choppy and irritating to listen to. Her voice was not what I expected. There is another version of this book narrated by another woman whose voice is smooth, and can put you to bed. Yet she tells the tale with enough excitement and with different tones for each character that you are compelled to listen ALL DAY!The plot is wonderful, though if you want to listen instead of read, I don't reccomend the Sandra Burr narration. I reccomend the one read by Rowena Cooper. AMAZING!
Negative	"Failed attempt at female empowerment: The basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical (or pre-historical?) fiction. However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal ""mind meld"" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. The only reason I give it two stars is because I like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting."
Negative	Don't bother reading the book: I was recommended this book by a family member. I'm going to be honest, this book is really bad. The main character is a Mary Sue type character (she can do everything perfectly, tame horses, etc) and it's like a Harliquin romance novel - because there's so much sex in it. This book was a complete waste of time.
Negative	really really bad: i find it incredible that so many people speak so glowingly of this book. on the basis of its literary merit it deserves a prominent spot in supermarket checkout lanes. that this is in any way respected as a novel or thought of as remotely historical (pre-historical, is suppose) speaks sad volumes about our society.i guess my one star may be a bit harsh. it's concievable that one could glean some amusement or light entertainment from this. but i feel a civic duty to in bring down the five star average it's garnered so far.
Positive	Not the same as pitchure: The book dose the job as far as that goes and it is a used book but I was expecting a newer book going by the pitchure
Negative	I read almost 5 pages!: An earthquake opens a crack in the earth, the parents fall in, and it slams shut!?!?!? That's the best Auel could do? Has that EVER happened in history to ANYONE?I read that and threw the book in the trash. And it wasn't even my copy!
Positive	Best book ever: This first book in my 62 years that has make me laugh & cry. It is an amazing story of a young women who suffering made her stronger to survive & to love unconditionally.
Positive	Good re-read!: So happy to find this book. I read the series several years ago and shall start them over this winter. Sent quickly & in good shape. Recommend this seller to all.
Positive	awesome reading: This book is the start of an incredible journey. It gives an insight to our origins in such a way that you can no longer doubt ourroots. Ayla is the epitome of all of us!
Positive	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I started reading Jean Auel's Earth Children series many years ago. I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive.
Positive	The Cave Bear Series The Claln of the Cave Bear.: I had lost the original book that I had purchased so I chose this oneTo replace the first book of this Earth's Children Series. I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.
Positive	Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel: I have read this book a few times since it came out. It had to be replaced because it was faling apart and I could not find anyone to repair it. Looking forward to getting the last book in the series in hardback.
Positive	such an intriguing idea: actually, an intriguing and literally epic idea. especially when I first read it, years ago, the idea of a female protagonist being the central figure not only of the story but of this stage in human, earthly development, was absolutely unique. I still find it so (I reread it)...
Positive	A Fantastic Read: I love to read, and I especially love to see a movie for the first time and find out that it was inspired by a novel. The Clan of the Cave Bear movie was good, but the book is amazing. Jean M. Auel tells an engaging story. Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep. I try to reread it at least once a year. If you like books that grab your attention and then refuse to let go-This is the book for you.
Positive	Finding a Treasure: Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!
Positive	"You will FALL IN LOVE with Auel's Ayla!!: You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously ""too perfect"" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."
Positive	"Clan of the Cave Bear: This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the ""Others"", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"
Positive	Very well researched and written.: Reading this book was an emotional experience. The author was able to describe scenes so accurate that I actually felt as if I were that little 5 year old girl, lost in the wilderness, hungry, cold, tired, delusional, and frightened. I was captivated with this series and reread all four books five times already. I've learned more about survival from this book than I have from 12 years in our public school systems. Great job. When's the wedding going to be written?
Positive	very exiting series: I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????
Positive	A wonderful story of early man.: I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
Positive	The best series of books out there: This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time.
Positive	Great Story - You will enjoy it.: This was a great book. Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today. As well as enjoying the story and learning about primative times you will also be thinking about how this can relate to today... Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read..
Positive	VERY GOOD, I WAS IMPRESSED AND WILL READ MORE: I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?
Negative	Prehistorical Meandering Story: The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else.
Positive	Magnificently compelling...: This is a wonderfully entertaining, well-written and thought provoking story. The author did a superb job of developing character and plot, leaving the reader with a lust for the story to continue.
Negative	"Amature.: I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:""I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.""Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."
Positive	clan of the cave bear: this book opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. she showed rational method as to how many discoveries could have come about. riding a horse for the first time must have been a true sight, it is taken for granted by us today but can you inagine what it must have been like to wittnes this for the first time. i have read all her books several times and been just as awe struck by every one.
Positive	This is an amazing book.: This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran
Positive	A Scientific Saga: I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga.
Negative	"Oh, puhleeeeaze!: I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
Negative	Compelling story but reads like a textbook: The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end.
Positive	"First in the series ..: This, the first book in the series of ""Earth's Children"" is a gripping, fascinating introduction to the first of our thinking ancestors. Almost as if we were there."
Positive	a wonderful epic: This is one long story that really takes you into the depth of prehistoric times and rituals. It's wonderfully researched and finely detailed. I read with wonder all the recipes for medicine. What herb cured or maintained certain diseases. The movie does this book absolutely no justice. What was Darrel Hannah thinking when she signed up for that bomb? This book takes a look at human relations and the beginnings of communication. A great read.
Negative	Not My Cup of Tea: I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for.
Positive	A moving book about the endurance of humanity: I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results.
Positive	HOURS OF GREAT READING......: I have the entire collection of Jean Auel's Children of the Earth series, and reread them over and over. Great books!
Negative	Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read.
Positive	A Must Read For Ice Age Purists!!!: Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
Positive	Added to my collection: I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection. It turned out to be a book club size and I traded it to a friend for the full size version.
Positive	I loved it.: I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change. She makes the characters real, you can sense and identify with their emotions. Hurry with that next book
Positive	original, and discriptive, Jean displays her imagination on: paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%
Positive	I really enjoy the series.: Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book.
Positive	Not the best of her books but still high quality...: The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to.
Positive	The clan Of the cave bear is a good book: It has an interesting plot and alot of great information. I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it
Negative	I really tried to like it: My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half. Really not very interesting. For whatever reason, women seem to find this book interesting. I have other male friends that have had the same experience. For me, nothing that grabbed my attention happened and the writing wasn't enough to make up for it.
Positive	"5+ stars. LO MEJOR DE LO QUE HE LEIDO EN MI VIDA.: Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.Un libro para leer y releer, es como un libro de superación personal, pero sin los aburridos consejos sabiondos de los autores, ni las falsas promesas de los nuevos autores llamados ""new age"". DEBE LEERLO, Y POR FAVOR, NO LO PRESTE.....!El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS.El libro de los viajes (""Plains""): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN ""cazadores"", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....""The Shelter of stone""...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."
Negative	"way too much: I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. The detailed and varied descriptions were simply unneccesary for a book that is touted as a ""must read"" for women as young as 10!"
Negative	Its really just a harlequin novel: If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc.
Positive	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I really loved this book and the books that follow this one, but I didn't really like the way the people's feelings are. I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do. Though the parts that confused me were the mogur ceremony and the earthquakes. Because in a way it makes it seem as if all the magic is real.
Positive	to much detail: Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details. But I guess that makes for a good book writer.
Negative	No plot, No Characters: One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them. Why the author felt she had to abandon any attempt at subtlety, and write as if the readers were as ignorant as her characters seem to be is beyond me.
Positive	Great. Really Great.: I really liked this book, I have always been interested in early man, and I think this book sheds new light on the way it could of been back then. I found this book facinating, and I think that it was a wonderful experence.Although she didn't have any facts she still did a good job of filling in those empty spaces.
Negative	Boring: Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.
Positive	The Clan of the Cave Bear: Several times over the years I've tried to read this..but every time it just didnt catch my interest enough....still,i was pretty sure at some point it Might be worth trying again..... So after many years i finally downloaded it to kindle and wow, it was terrific... Now i'm hooked on reading the entire series. Try it, YOU might love it too!
Positive	Interesting: Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.
Positive	An exquisitely written adventure!: I have read these books to the point of wearing out my paperbacks. Ayla is the role model I never had as a young girl and sets a high standard for all of us to attain. I was completely transported to a different place and time while I read each story and felt drawn toward these marvelously written characters. I am so anxious for Ms. Auel's next creation I cannot pass a bookstore, anywhere, without checking to see if it's in yet. Please hurry, Jean!
Positive	"A little much for a 14 year old: Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the ""clans"" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"
Positive	Very good reading.: I loved all three books. I had read the Shelters of Stone first as it was a gift, but thoroughly enjoyed going back to see where it all began. Amazing author.
Positive	2nd time around: This is the second time I am ready this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first read them. The main Character Ayla is wonderful and you become very attached to her from the time you meet her at age 5 through her life. You root for her and cry for her. I can wait to start book 2,3,4,....until the last book which recently came out in 2012.Well worth the 500+ pages
Positive	Clan of the Cave Bear, a true classic: Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before.
Positive	First in the series. Great read.: If you enjoy anthropology, archeaology, and learning about the first of mankind on our planet, then you will find this entire series plausibe, and very enjoyable reading. This is a series of books that completely holds your attention through every page. Every book is based on thorough research of ancient sites, tools, and other findings that tell us about the people of yesteryear and how they survived the glacier period. The characters are so well presented that they seem real. Each additional novel is a continual saga from the prior book, so continuity flows very well.
Positive	Great story, excellent insight into prehistoric man: While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)
Positive	Cave of the Clan Bear: Cave of the Clan Bear is well written. It moves quickly. The descriptions of the venue are detailed enough to draw the reader into the scene and the little girl's trials are believable.
Negative	I Know I'm in the Minority Here, But...: I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening.
Negative	Kindle's edition is full of typos: The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books.
Negative	"Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.: Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
Positive	"This series is a ""keeper"": Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."
Positive	"Great Book: Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, ""Clan of the Cave Bear "" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get."
Negative	amazing: it amazes me that after so many years and so much exposure that this book is still in print. the only story i have ever read that is worse than these is Moby Dick. the only thing worse than those 2 books are the movie adaptations. i'd rather pull out my own fingernails with red hot pliers than to read the cave bear again. a insanely long and over written pile of trite tripe.'a festering bag of fish entrails' is too kind a review for this load of sewage. if anyone tries to make you read this book, slit your wrists and fling yourselve from a cliff first - it will be less painfull.
Positive	"The Clan Of The Cave Bear, and the other books were great.: In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her ""tribe"" gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book! Even though I started the series when I was in the sixth grade, last year, I love this series, and have already finished it. I'm dying to read the next one."
Positive	Great Read: I am currently still reading this book. I'm having a great time reading it and I love how every scene is so perfectly described and full of details.It's one of those books that you have to stop reading now and then, so that you can let your imagination fly and Imagine how would you survive in such conditions and time period.Simply fantastic.
Positive	"BEST of the series...unfortunately: This is the first book in the ""earth's children"" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"
Positive	So Much Detail that the Story Come to Life: I read this book a few years back but couldn't resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account.Jean Auel is one of my favorite authors. I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!
Positive	Clan of the Cave Bear, good read.: This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times. It is a fiction for both sexes, as both my son and daughter loved reading and listening to the audio cd's.
Positive	A fascinating tale: This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older.
Positive	I fell in love with this book from the first page......: TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it.
Positive	"Prehistoric Research Fiction?: I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (""the clan"") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."
Positive	"YOU MADE ME FEEL I WAS AYLA!: WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT? THERE HAS TO BE A #5. I WILL READ EVERY BOOK YOU WRITE IF THEY ARE LIKE THE ""AYLA"" JOURNEY."
Negative	Tripe, and not very good tripe at that: lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash.
Negative	"Neanderthal Sexists: This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters ""made the sign"" indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs."
Negative	Horrid!: I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time.
Positive	Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. I would purchase a used book again from this source.
Positive	One of the best books I have ever read: I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels.
Positive	Sensational.: I enjoyed this book a lot. It was difficult for me to put it down at times. The end of the book leaves you captivated. It makes you want to start the next book in the series as soon as possible.
Positive	Beautiful!!: I was hooked from the first page!! This is the best book ever written! If you have read this book, read the others, they keep getting better!! When is the next book coming out?
Positive	there's nothing better than this: I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new book to read. When I found my mom's old tattered copy of Clan of the Cave Bears, I didn't expect much. Oh my goodness, though, Auel is a virtuoso. I cannot wait for the next one!
Positive	EXCELENT!!!: It's just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. These series have given to humanity a great gift. Thanks a lot Ms. Auel. I hope you will continue the Ayla's story. I've been waiting for years to continue the story, I'm sure you have too much to write. When the next book will be coming out?. Every time I go to a bookstore I look for the next one.
Positive	Cave Woman: I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE.
Positive	Very Good, But Not For Immature Children: This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book.
Positive	Totally addictive: Loving this series. Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more
Positive	Read this book and get hooked on the entire series!: A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family. She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M. Auel series.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child
Positive	Fascinating!: I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself.
Positive	AMAZING series: I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay.
Positive	The Clan of the Cave Bear: I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book.
Positive	Simply Fantastic!: It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)
Positive	This is one of the most beautiful books I've read.: What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end
Positive	My thoughts: I read the book many years ago, and decided to reread due to liking the book so well and when I am finished, my granddaughter will read
Positive	Enchanting and Creative: I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
Positive	Highly recommended to me, and I agree: On a number of occasions, it had been suggested that I read this book, and I must say I'm very glad I did. I got very involved, as the writing was so wonderfully descriptive. Having said this, I don't think it was arduous to read all that detail, which sometimes makes reading a book feel a bit of a chore. I would recommend it to anyone!
Positive	What I expected: Friend told me about the book , have not started to read it yet. Hope it is as good as she said.
Positive	Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation: Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
Positive	"brief overview: This is not a book, its a pamphlet that gives a very terse overview of the PL/I language. Its not a beginners book but a primer for experienced programmers. The only current book on PL/I is ""The New PL/I"" by Eberhard Sturm which is already out of print after being out less than 2 years"
Positive	for beginners: This is a very good book for the beginners to gain a overall knowledge of PL/1 and start making small programs.
Positive	Nice for NYG Fans!: Very nice Floor Mats. Bought these for my Honda Civic and they work great. Super deal. Shipping was very fast and they were exactly as I expected. A little small so they should fit just about all vehicles. Might be too small for large trucks.
Negative	Very bad logo!! You cant see it.: the shipping was fast, as usual by Amazon. The product is terrible, you can barely see the logo, its not a real Colts blue, more of a very dark navy almost purple color. They will be going back. I should have known the price was too good to be true for a product of any real value.
Negative	"trouble with car not matts: Matt on driver side slides forward and I have not found a way to anchor it. It would be better if the Broncos had gone to the Super Bowl in 2013. The ""Prayer in thin Air"" did them in or was it ""The kneel down in D Town?"""
Positive	Smooth, great color, and good price: I happened upon this product at Nordstrom's Rack and picked up one. Boy did I wish I had grabbed a handful. I have been buying Origin's automatic lip liner for about $22.00 a pop and these are just as good, if not better. On a lark I searched Amazon to see if they had them. Yep! I use the Black Berry as I like to wear dark and wine colored lipsticks. I am going to grab a handful this time. The liner goes on easily and keeps my lipstick in place. Makes a nice frame for the lipstick.
Negative	"Bless her heart for writing this: This book is the worst! It is more like a journal than advice on how to deal with a child with SID. No reference is made as to what works and what doesn't. Mrs. Wilson uses this as a forum to slam her son's teachers and class mates. She even refers to a 2nd grader as the ""son of Satan""- Nice and very Christian of you....It appears that Mrs. Wilson thinks she's doing something benefical for others but don't waste your money here. If you are looking for a book to help you cope with your child's SID this is not it."
Positive	Fun Read!: This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!
Positive	Pictures!: I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
Positive	Very dated: If you love Dear Abby, you'll love this book. It is very dated however. She had quite a sense of humor and it is evident in this book. A mindless, time passing read.
Positive	Lots of fun for Dear Abbey lovers: This book was great! Lots of old Dear Abbey letters with background information on the thoughts that were behind the answers.
Positive	Excellent reference guide: I work at a Wild Birds Unlimited store and customers rely on you to give them the best information on bird feeding and care available. This book is super helpful in achieving that goal.
Positive	"Will take a 15.5"" laptop: I have an XPS GEN 2 Inspiron which is 15.5"" long. I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5"" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16"" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack."
Negative	poor quality backpack, don't buy...: I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!
Negative	Mind boggling design flaws: I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs, and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.
Positive	"Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!: Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
Positive	Another reason to suscribe to Prime: This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn't suscribed to Amazon Prime. I'm not getting any perks, etc, for reccomending Amazon Prime, but one of the features is the instant video. While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good. I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein ofThe Descendants.
Positive	Gripping Film: Very good acting. Very emotional. I empathized with every character! I was very impressed with the the actors and writers, who weaved the story in a way that we were kept on edge wondering with the characters, what was going on.
Positive	great story, well directed, fine acting: This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!
Positive	Captivating, Engaging, Wonderful: Completely captivating and amazing. When I saw the movie I knew nothing about it and I am glad otherwise the plot would have been ruined. So, I won't say anything about the plot.This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.The DVD has very few Special Features. But, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are preceded by an interview with the director explaining why each of them was cut out of the film.
Positive	What A Story!!!: It fires on all engines and pulls you right in!Compassionate, heart-wrenching, happy and sad at once, this incredible story will resound within long after the credits roll by at the end.It's keenly raw, honest, and emotionally intense.
Positive	If only Hollywood could offer something this good: I saw the previews for this movie while waiting for my main feature it seemed interesting so I remembered the title and I am so glad I did. Excellent story, excellent acting without it be overdramatized. I will add this to my collection.
Positive	review: don't let the bad cover art fool you. I saw this in the theaters and bought it immediately when it came out on DVD. A powerful film. To say any more to be to give it away.
Positive	Worthy of Several Academy Nominations: Director Susanne Bier, Best Screenplay writers Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, Best Actor Rolf Lassgrd, Best Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, and a few other supporting and camera work nominations would not surprise me. I will be disappointed if they are not rewarded for the talent and intelligence evident in this film. After the Wedding is so honestly human that it does indeed break your heart. Happily it also hands you hope, a little laughter, and moments of tender warmth and love.
Positive	Very Nearly Perfect: This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie.
Positive	Traveled to Sweden.: This was such a beautiful film. Breathtaking! The best part was watching it with my movie buddy Sandra Zhao! I cannot wait to see it again. I truly felt like the movie had taken me on a trip to Denmark. I have still not watched the Lives of Other's which beat Pan's Labyrinth and this movie for Best Foreign Film. Can't wait to see it.
Positive	very good: Beautiful movie. I always admired Danish cinematography and this feature was the best so far. Fabulous set of very talented actors. I loved it and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
Positive	Moving story and film: I enjoyed this film. Although a tear jerker, I thought the acting was well done and the script was well written.
Positive	Alls well that ends well: This is a perfect story of everything working out in the end. Im getting married and so decided to watch all the wedding movies I could find this didn't disappoint at all. It was great to watch a non-american film gives you an eye into other cultures.
Positive	"Excellent Enz: Although a little uneven, this release has two timeless ballads (""Iris"" and ""One Step Ahead"") and some rollicking good time pop songs (History Never Repeats, I Don't Wanna Dance, Hard Act To Follow) and the dazzling ""Ships"" which is one of my favorite Enz songs. Actually I think it is better than thier debut and shows a lot of growth."
Positive	"The real story of globalization: ""Before one can cry Big Mac, Larsson humbles the critic of globalization into silence. Larsson is William Blake's ""Mental Traveler,"" taking the reader through ""a land of men and women"": the slums of Rocinha in Rio where police are more dangerous than gangsters; a Bosnian mother supporting her blind husband and mentally retarded daughter on sweater knitting. Put down your placard and have a veggie burger, this guy's been there.""- Zachary Wales, Business Correspondent, United Press International"
Negative	Sunny Side Up: I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book.
Negative	is that fencer attacking with a bent arm?: and what is with the foot?Usually a preview should (as far as I know) show a good example that will motivate people to watch moreof it and this just isn't it...I haven't viewed the video or part you can download as yet but if this picture is an example of what it contains I am not too inclined to view more of it...what are these two fencers doing?is the one on the right attacking with a foot in the air,next arm and point way off target or are they retreating ?and if so what the .. are they doing? Balance?!?and the fencer on the left - are they attacking? bent arm? what is with the front foot?ok so maybe need to download it and view it but I have enough faults in my technique without viewing this....sorry was just looking up fencing on amazon and found this video download...sighand if you are wondering I have over 20 years of fencing - all three weapons and I like to think (some... may disagree...lol) that I am an ok fencer...
Negative	"One of the worst movies I've ever seen: Poor story, worse acting, appalling film making. This film sems to have been made to ""showcase"" the dubious talent of its maker and lead ""actor"". I've seen hammers with more expression and talent. Don't bother unless you're masochistic enough to sit through it. Less enjoyable than chewing tyres."
Positive	A powerful, moving film you can't stop watching....: even as it races towards its inevitable and forgone conclusion. This movie reached me in a place I didn't even know I had. Jesus Nebot's acting and directing ability should make him an international star. To me the two main characters in this drama are Pablo and Mrs. Knight, the bereaved mother (played by JAG's Susan Haskell in a gut-wrenching performance), forever connected to each other by an accidental tragedy with a cosmic resolution. This movie will stay with you.
Negative	"Incorrect Order & Product Color Inconsistent: I ordered:4 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft BeigeThey sent:3 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft Beige -- (Note: See Color inconsistency note below)1 - Almay Liquid Makeup (which I did not order)Each of the 3 Revlon bottles was labeled as ""05 Soft Beige"" but visually looking at the makeup through the glass bottles, side by side, the actual color was markedly inconsistent.Out of the 4 bottles which I ordered, and paid for, only 1 was usable.Due to their lack of accuracy on the order fulfillment and the lack of quality control of the product, I will not order from them again."
Negative	"""Age defying"" doesn't quite fit the product: I am a very young looking 61 years old woman. I don't wear foundation on regular basis, but sometimes I like to look extra nice. Revlon's age defiying foundation doesn't fit it's name. It looks good when you put it on, but after wearing it few hours, it magnifies every line on my face..actually I see some I never seen before. Honestly, if this is what make up foundation will do, I'll be much more content without it. Show me one that doesn't do it, and I'll become a believer... But surely, to call it age defying, it is simply not true!"
Negative	Not what she wanted: Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she read a few pages and quit because it was too sad. I told her it had a good ending but she won't try again, be prepared for tears when you read this one.
Negative	sent wrong thing: I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both books (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it. The book looked nothing like the picture and it was very cleared written that I was supposed to get both. I got jipped.
Positive	Child called it: this book is so heart felt. He makes you wonder how the system failed him and many others. I always wondered how his mother was never charged of put in jail for life. The very least be treated the same way.
Negative	"A Child Called ""IT"" and The Lost Boy One Child 's Courage to Survive: Ordered this for Christmas about 3 weeks before it never came before or after, never had any response, very disappointed."
Positive	Oustanding Historical Reference Volume: This work is an exhaustive study of the Luftwaffe's inventory from 1931 - 1945. Naturally the famous are here: Ju87, Me109/110/262, Fw190, He111/162, but the obscure as well: the Bv40 Interceptor Glider(!), the asymmetric Bv141 observation aircraft, and the He100 fighter. The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning. Over 150 fixed-wing aircraft, gliders and helicopters are combined with an excellent overview of the Luftwaffe from creation to destruction. Additionally, appendices contain the Luftwaffe's chain of command, and a glossary of Luftwaffe-speak.If you are a student of WW2, and particularly the airwar, then you should definitely try to pick up a copy. Highly recommended.
Positive	BEST HOCKEY GAME EVER!!: This is the best hockey game ever. You'll never want to stop. There is every team and player. Theres a mode were 2 people can play each other and you can just play the com. just for fun. There is also a franchise mode where you go threw as many seasons as you want. You can also trade players and sign free agents. Theres also a draft after each season. You can also set the difficilly level to any thing you want. Theres also a season mode where you can just go through only 1 season. Also theres a playoffs mode were you skip the season and go right to the playoffs. It has the best grafics too. The bad thing is that you can't create your own team like in NFL 2K3. I recremend this game to everyone...
Negative	Over-rated!!: I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. Even NHL Face-off is better than NHL 2k3. The graphics are only average and the controls are horrible. It feels like the players are skating in sand. The replays are ok but this game doesn't even have a create-a-player option. Sega should stick to football and basketball. Sorry Sega but I miss your Genesis games!
Negative	THIS GAME STINKS!...: The only way to score on this game is dekes, rebounds and defelections. The gameplay stinks, the commontary stinks, DO NOT...waist your money on this game.
Positive	Great Game.... :): This is a game everyone should play, great storyline, great graphics, and REALLY fun! I am proud to own the game and I reccommend it to about everyone!
Positive	the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: in this game other than the fighting style the animated cut scenes have the best graphics. If your a fire emblem fan youmust buy this or just trying something new rent the game atblockbuster or at gamefly.com
Positive	Best Fire Emblem Yet: I have this game and have beaten but boy it was hard. It took me like a month to beat it. What I love about it is it's on the Gamecube, their are little movie clips, the action and the adventure you take. I don't like that they took choosing classes away and the plot is later on in the story. BUY THIS GAME NOW!
Positive	Fire Emblem on Game Cube: This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the story line is prety good. It has the weapon triangle like the rest of them, but the magic triangle changed which stinks. But, still in this one, you can give your units extra experience, you get to forge your own weapons, and you can change the color which is cool. The graphics are a bit better. But, still the same types of batte maps. Overall, this game is awesome!!!
Negative	Worst game I have ever played: Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever.
Positive	Best Fire Emblem Yet: This game is awesome! I got it and couldn't stop playing! The graphics are awesome! I played the two english fire emblems before it, but this one beats them all. The story line is pretty good,the graphics are awesome, cool new 'abilities' or 'skills', and able to choose weapon after class change. The only con for this game is that if you've ever played Fire Emblem Sacred Stones, you will find out that this game loses the choices of classes to change into. Multiple chapters or 'levels' to play through, many recruitable characters, new types of magic, and a bunch of new weapons. There are also new classes, including beasts and ravens. I hope you buy this game and that this guide has been helpful to you.
Positive	Very fun game: In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting.
Positive	Epic fun.: This has been an amazing experience to play and has a great chance to be one of the best Gamecube games I have played ever. One of the best games ever too. Definitely pick it up as it has lots of everything you can ask for. Definitely up there with FE7 as the best of the series.
Positive	One of if not the greatest game I have ever played: This is a fantastic and near perfect game. The only minor imperfections are lack of some gameplay features that are added in the sequel. The characters are very interesting and unlike most games are not mere cliches to create gameplay. It does not have any fan service at all and is better because of it.
Positive	another winner by mustang: It may be a five,but I won't actually get another ride in this year. The seat looks great, shipped fast and was easy to install. It certainly is heavier than the stock seat and wider with more back support.
Negative	Crappy workmanship: One of the three pliers did not work at all when I got it. I had to take a file to modify the thing so the locking mechanism would engage.
Negative	"RIP OFF, STOLEN WORKS: Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Instead buy the REAL thing, ""Let There Be Light"", by Darius Dinshah. Nothing else to say. Rip Off of Darius Dinshah's father's works!!!!!!!"
Negative	Reminds me of a joke...: What do you call the medical school student who graduates at the bottom of the class? Doctor.
Positive	A surprisingly effective fantasy for beginning readers: If you want to introduce the fantasy genre to a younger reader, I can't imagine a better starting place than this book. A lot of story is packed into this beginning chapter book. Although some profound issues are raised, I think what will appeal to most young readers is the adventure and the relationship between the boy and the new pet he brings home - which, in this case, happens to be a dragon! Readers will no doubt want to read the rest of the books in this series which, though not as good, are certainly entertaining.
Positive	My daughter Love it!: My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan. This book, although she read it for school, she loved it. We read it once every 2 weeks, she now has certain lines memorized and loves to read it with me.
Negative	Where are the Pictures?: I am very disappointed in this book. When I looked at it on Amazon there were pictures. Why was it not mentioned that there were no pictures in this particular book?Shame on you for misrepresenting this book. Now I have to return it and get one with Edward Lear's imaginative art work as well.
Negative	"Disappointed: I ""bought"" this book for Kindle. All I got when I tried to read the book was a list of numbers that didn't correspond to anything. I'm glad the book was free so I can delete this without being out anything."
Negative	pointless rubbish: Just as the title says, book of nonsense. A book of poorly written rhymes, lacking even a hint of smutty humour.
Negative	Limericks: If you are looking for a nonsense limerick, this is the book for you - otherwise, keep looking. I kept looking.
Negative	Weird, Uncomprehendable Book: This has to be the dumbest book I've read. It has riddles and rhymes that totally don't make sense. I know I would rather read real poetry and literature, not this. I don't even think that small kids would like this confusing book.
Negative	???: This thing has about 3 poems in it. Terrible! Do NOT waste your time!!!!!!! Extra words extra words extra words
Positive	"The Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear: He is the best of all writers of nonsense verse. He wrote ""The Owl and the Pussycat ""The Nonsense ABCs"", and numerous limmericks.dwahl"
Negative	"This should not be listed on Amazon: This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
Positive	"Excellent, classic, but...: I'm going to review this briefly as a book for children, which is what it is. I read most of this to my 3-year-old (including all the limericks and most of the poems, and a little of the other stuff). As long as I didn't read it too often, my son was usually game for this. He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.""The Owl and the Pussycat"" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition. It would help if the pictures were in color, but I gather you're getting it closer to what was published in the 19th century here."
Negative	Formatting problems: The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out. This one was quite disappointing, since the limericks it contains appear as continuous text, so are quite inconvenient to read. It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!
Negative	Kindle version - lost formatting: Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one.
Negative	Not really readable: There are headings for pictures, but no pictures. So half the content is missing from this edition. And, the remaining limericks are just silly.
Positive	WWE Road to Being the Best Game on the GameBoy Advance...: This game is so awesome, I got this game on Christmas Day and once I the plastic off, I grabbed my GBA and put it in. There are a huge variety of game modes in this game. Although this game only has 15 characters, this game is very attractive. The characters are very recognizable. And unlike the first Road to Wrestlemania, each character has a unique moveset. For example: The Rock has his Layin' the SmackDown Punch Rush, Undertaker has the Chokeslam and the Tombstone, Triple H has his Jumping Knee Attack, Chin Crusher, and his Spinebuster. The championship mode on this game is fun, although no storylines. You can win merchandise from ShopZone by by doing special tasks. You can create a PPV, but you must make the events enjoyable not only to the fans, but...Vince McMahon! Overall, this game is a great game, I recommend this to any Pro Wrestling fan. It is a fun and enjoyable game.
Negative	enterence video: there is no enterence video,no storylines,much lesser wrestlers so its not enjoyable playing mode, so please next time just think about this things so it can be enjoyable while playing on GBA.
Negative	Wrestlecrap: This is very slow and very limited. It has better graphics than Road to Wrestlemania but does not compare to it in anyway in terms of gameplay.Also it doesn't have STONE COLD STONE COLD THE RATTLESNAKE STONE COLD
Positive	GREAT STUFF: If you want some good ol' fashion raw speed metal, this is your album. Fast, loud, and raw. This is one Motorhead album, ofcourse Motorhead is one great band. So yea, if you want some good speed metal this is for you.
Positive	"Where to start with MOTORRRRRHEAD?: I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... ""Overkill"" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as ""Metropolis"", ""Stay Clean"" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of ""Overkill"" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover ""Louie Louie"" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice."
Positive	"Good, but it gets better: Motorhead put their blueprint together for this album, and it is very good (especially ""Pay Your Price"" and ""I'll be Your Sister"") but they still needed to hone in on the speed and aggression."
Positive	"Great Early Motörhead: One of Motörhead's best, ... offers their usual mix of groove infused speed metal with some atmosphere (""Capricorn"") and punk inspired hark rock (""Tear Ya Down""). A very strong album, with no weak tracks!"
Negative	Wrong info: I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. I do love this album from Motorhead though.
Positive	"The Perfect Portfolio: ""Perfect"" This book was incredibly helpful. I am just beginning to put my portfolio together and this book helped immensely. I found out what type of photos I should have, how they should be displayed, etc. Great Book!"
Positive	"Better than New: I borrowed a copy of this book from a friend who said it only had 2 readings.When my ""used"" copy arrived through Amazon, it was like new, even betterthan my friend's. I am very pleased."
Negative	Boring, ideas, not worth it!: I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween book, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy. After looking at it, the book was returned.Words cannot even describe the dissappointment I felt after glancing through it. Boring, old, uninviting, crafty suggestions. If you are looking for a good Halloween book for the not too crafty or the not too gory, games, treats, decorations, try 101 Halloween Ideas.
Negative	"So much potential.: This is one of those books that I like the *idea* of, but not so much the execution. It's gotten to the point where if a book has the word ""spooky"" (or a variation) on the cover, I'm just going to assume it's not. The idea - offering ideas for six themed parties - would make for an excellent book if they were all actually Halloween-themed. Sadly, even the Halloween-specific party suggestions fall a little flat."
Positive	Thuvia is great: As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series). As a youth, when I first bought the book, I had my doubts; having cut my 'martian teeth' on Pricess and Warlord. However, true to Burroughs style, the action picked up quickly and was on par with the other books in the series. A great read.
Positive	I adore this series: Romantic, full of action and rich dialogue and imagery, this series will last forever (despite the epic fail of the Disney movie).
Negative	Less substance than a Cugel novel.: Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance...
Positive	A good read.: Follow John Carter's son Carthoris on his first adventure in the series. It was a quick read for me that left me looking forward to the next book.
Positive	classic: Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction.Our hero is framed for the abduction of princess Thuvia, so he goes to rescue her and clear his name.It's also a pretty classic romance plot, with the hero and heroine in love with each other, but unsure how the other feels, and societal/political conventions standing in their way. *shhhh... don't tell.
Negative	not good: I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
Positive	Better than I remembered it!: Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individual's right to seek success, the strength to stand up for one's own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didn't see the recent movie that came out based on the series; kind of glad that I didn't. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide.
Positive	A great find!: I recently discovered this band while surfing the net.I sampled a few songs off their website,and I really loved Bemoaned Animosity.I wasn't sure if I'd like them that much,but wow was I wrong.Their tagline says it all,Death Trash Chaos!This cd has got to be one of my favorites,an instant classic for me.I find it difficult to compare them to other bands,as they have their own sound.My sister chuckled when she heard the name of the cd,but after she heard the title track,she was hooked and loves it as much as I do.It's certainly heavy,but blends thrash and death metal so well that I never really notice,cause I'm to busy head bangin'!
Positive	Metal all the way.: This band has some very good music. The track 'Let Me Be Your Tank' has to be my favorite off the entire album.
Positive	Cheaper (and maybe better than) a Therapist: Though not a fan of his astrological writings for Vanity Fair, this book is mind-blowing. I have had it for over 20 years (even had it rebound at Kinkos). It has truly helped me reinterpret the motivation of countless people in my life in a way that's helped me improve those relationships. It's a book like no other in the way it helps me make sense of other people's actions by understanding their point of view (haven't read his new book yet).
Positive	astrology: This a the book everyone should have- from serious students of the stars, to consultants, to people who know nothing at all about astrology. It's brilliant, hilarious, and ORIGINAL. You won't find a lot of this information in any other astrology books and it is accurate-
Positive	Couldn't Be Better!: Having never heard of this band before, I picked up this album from a Border's Bookshop store where I could sample the tunes first. Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing. I cannot recomment this album more highly!
Positive	A very good album: The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch.
Positive	A sonic summer's day: I think this is the best Sea & Cake album so far. Song for song, this stands up against any of their previous albums, and it's their most cohesive album to date as well. The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences. There are touches of synthesizers, there are breezes of strings, the guitars dance around each other, the drums create rhythms that are part latin, part kraut rock, while the bass anchors the entire album, creating a foundation (a mobile dynamic foundation) for the other players to weave their sounds around.
Positive	"whoa: Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to ""all the Photos"" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."
Positive	"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music.....: Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
Negative	"Snoozic: This idea was interesting on their earlier albums. If I listen to Oui ten times, I can't recall a single song, or even a single idea. Nothing here is memorable. It's sonic wallpaper. If you like this record, you sure are in luck. There are thousands of boring, fungible records like this released in the mid-60s from Brazil, France, etc. This is not to say that all of this type of stuff is worthless. Rather, now that the Sea and Cake's output is an emotionally devoid genre exercise, there are many other mediocre examples to collect and savor. I'm sure most of them are similarly ""positive,"" as our reviewer friend from Venezuela found Oui to be."
Negative	"Boring: Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and ""Afternoon Speaker"" is it. It even gets a bit monotonous, but at least it's perky and interesting. Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep."
Negative	OK: Pretty horrible. Like in WWE women cant wrestle.Expecially harcore wrestling.Sexxxy eddy was the best part of the whole dvd. There is no bonus matches wtf!? It says there are but there isnt its just the tournament. Do not buy! I should have listened to the review but i didnt
Positive	"A ""MUST HAVE"" book for IBD info: I have been so impressed by this book. As a UC sufferer of many years, I really felt at home reading it. There were so many things that I could relate to! The information is up-to-date and incredibly informative and helpful! And the quotes from everyone are just great - they really touched my heart and helped me to know that I am not alone in my thoughts and feelings.For those with IBD, or their friends and family, this book is an exceptional addition to the library. If you buy nothing else regarding this disease, buy this one!"
Negative	"completely useless - garbage: at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program... cheap, uses up very minimal resources, simple to use.. lifetime subscription for free.. what could be wrong?EVERYTHING. see, the problem isn't that this program can't find viruses.. the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. that's right, it leaves the viruses right there!! how is that useful in any way? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses, but still the log report would announce to me ""(this many) viruses could not be deleted or cleaned."" well, thanks for nothing. i'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program."
Negative	Subscription Flawed?: Bought the 2005 program in the spring. I've been using this program for about 4 months, now the program prompts me to renew my subcription. I can't manually run a virus scan because the program requests that I renew my subcription. Other programs give you one year of use before renewing. I'm not certain if this product is working correctly. I'm going to use a different product instead.
Negative	Beware, it crashed my Hard disk!: I downloaded EZ Antivirus trial version from CA and Installed it on my laptop (XP Professional SP1). After installation the software started scanning automatically, which I allowed it to do and left my laptop alone. The laptop caught my attention when it started rebooting again and again. I realized my hard disk was also making a lot of noise.I went to CA's website and couldn't find any number to call. So I started web chat with their support. The support said that I might have installed the software with another anti-virus already working on my laptop. As per him, now only Microsoft can fix my problem. He said he would escalate the issue and copy me the email, which I'm still awaiting.To fix my hard disk I tried XP setup, Restore disks, and even reformatting the hard disk. Nothing works. I had to throw the hard disk.So just a friendly warning... stay away!!!
Negative	breaks other programs, can't uninstall: DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. On install the etrust antivirus software (nothing else just antivirus) broke my Zone Alarm firewall, interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up. I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install; they keep popping up with guess what error message? That's right, please uninstall Etrust antivirus software, it is incompatible with our software. I've emailed Etrust and tried thier 'live' online chat and get no response. The software is evil, it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it. I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand. Don't repeat my mistake!!!
Negative	Very Disappointed: I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply. The reply was to go to their update center and to renew. I sure wasn't going to pay again for something I only had for two months and its suppose to last for a year.I'll be going back to my trusted Norton Antivirus, it may be slow but at least I only have to buy it once a year.
Negative	Unable to uninstall: Once my year-long subscription expired, I have been unable to uninstall CA ETrust. It now pops up a nag window about every 20 minutes, and when you click exit, it pops up a browser window and takes you to CA's web page. I have tried uninstalling many different ways to no avail. This has been going on for months and makes my computer painful to use.My attempts to reach support are futile. Their support page doesn't work in my browser (IE 6.0) and the phone line is pay (which I will probably end up paying).This is much worse than a virus. At least with a virus I can go buy Norton and clean things up.
Negative	Stoner Rock, I think not!: First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed.
Negative	POOR Quality, stay away!!: One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof.
Negative	Couldn't use it: After adjusting the leg pieces for several days (wearing socks & boots)and then even replacing these with foam rolls I still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product, even at a 45degree incline. I know somebody else who has one and they like it so I guess it depends on the person, I am not heavy for my size and never thought this would be an issue.
Negative	Does not work with palm easily: Did not work with my Palm T|C right away.I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C.
Positive	card is actually 66x not 133x: The product title is incorrect. This card is 10MB/s (up to 66x). That is what it actually says on the box, not 133x. It isn't a problem for me because 66x is plenty fast for my panasonic fx30 camera. But if you really require 133x (i.e. 20MB/s) this is not the card for you.
Negative	Do not order this part from RitzCamera: I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). Ritzcamera will cheat you. You can find the part they sent me for $20 less on Amazon with free shipping.
Negative	I don't have answers to your questions: I gave this item as a gift. I don't have answers to your questions. I thought the doll was very expensive. Diane
Positive	This book explains the work of God in a way that make sense.: This book answers hard questions regarding God and our existance in a way that is very racional. I could not find one thing that didn't have a logical explanation regarding the spiritual way of looking at things. It is bealtiful, positive, and only talks about love. It has helped me see life in a different way and respect God's work. I learned that he is in charge at all times, protecting us, and will give us eternal life. This knowledge will help you cope better with every day life issues, tragedies, etc. I hope everyone in the world would read this book and live accordingly, which will happen with time.
Negative	NOT REALLY A LUNCH BOX: This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price.
Negative	"Overpriced: I cannot believe the ""discounted"" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3.00 (that's right, $20 less). Search on ""key float""."
Positive	Well worth the price: Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else.It bolted up almost perfectly, had to pull one corner slightly to line up with the mounting hole, but this was not hard to solve.Packaging was a little scanty for a heavy product, but again, for the low price it came in great condition, just a few scratches because the box was broken in a few places. But this product is going under my car, not to be seen and polished.Very good value, I would recomend this to anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive hitch receiver.
Negative	Doesn't fit!: The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it.
Positive	An honest look at goaltending: I found this book to be an honest look at the world of hockey goaltending from mites to the pros. My son, who is a youth hockey goalie, enjoyed reading Robb's history and hockey philosophy. A good book for all hockey goalie parents, especially those who are new to the goalie world.
Negative	I've never heard a worse one: In all the years of my life, I'm sure I've never heard such an awful musical. No wonder it was a flop! The story is ridiculous, the songs are silly and the music is incredibly bad. It makes COCO, BIG or LI'L ABNER ( a trilogy of disastrous music) sound like WEST SIDE STORY. Among the ten worst Broadway musicals of all times, this one has the honor to be TOP 1!
Positive	Inspiring to tree-huggers!: This book is a great book for those who care about the earth. There are so many great quotes and stories that are still relevant to our societal values. We use this book at camp to open campers' eyes to the world around them. The contents are a great inspiration and conversation starters.
Negative	You don't buy this one for the plot or the acting.: What little plot there is is an old one. Aliens send a rep. here to look us over. Only this one is only interested in our sex lives. Plenty of good looking babes. No acting tallent. The music bites.
Negative	Pervasive Silicone Enhancement: Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com).
Positive	great movie: this movie was for both men and women. the shots in the movie were very well done, the music was cool and it is one I would be pleased to own. It had a style that made sex very sexy and not dirty.
Negative	Relaxing viewing time: A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
Negative	Femalien: For this kind of movie your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. But that's what happened.Only 1 person could act. Most of the women where max 5s. The best part of the movie is the front cover.
Negative	Femalien: This is one of the worst plots, but no worse than many porn plots. The Femalien, who is obviouslyover-sexed, is sent to Earth to observe and participate in human experience -- almost all of it sexual. Contains frontal nudity.
Negative	Crappy: Should have 0-star as a choice. Horrible excuse for a sci-fi movie. I don't see what the other reviewers seen in here. Poor DVD quality. Lucky for me, I don't plan on watching it again.
Positive	Aliens Study the Sensual Arts: I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon. As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien. Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions. The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for.
Negative	Femalien: The R rated DVD of this movie is not worth the price. It's cut to smithereens. Buy the unrated version, instead.
Negative	See It: See this move for Matt Schue. I think that is his name. If it is the long haired blonde dude. He is so hot.
Negative	Don't waste your money!: No plot,waste of time and money in this 'Disney Porn' flick with ugly girls and stupid story line,Stay away!!!
Negative	Femalien: A soft adult movie. Good to watch once if you are in the mood for that type of movie.Save your money and get something else.
Positive	Good ending: While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad.
Negative	"Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!: Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."
Negative	"Wow, what a letdown: I thought this movie was going to have an incredible plot - All I wanted was to be able to go home and watch a really bad movie. This movie was different. It went beyond the limit of manass. It would have been better with Chuck Norris- 10 TIMES BETTER. ""Sun"" should have had more speaking parts where we could get to know her better. Next time, see Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie instead."
Negative	"Nil Science Fiction, Strong Sexual Content: Because this video in unrated and carries no warning in the information area I feel shoppers should be aware that this by all rights a soft core porn film with strong sexual content and little science fiction. I bought the VHS version from another source expecting the sort of movie ""Roger Corman Presents"" might sponsor, something along the lines of ""Species"" or Amanda & the Alien. While more in the vein of the latter the sci-fi part, {or any other technology for that matter}, is limited to a few teleportations via telekinesis and some aura/emotion melding. The movie is probably 60% by time made of sexual contact. Technically the movie is suprisingly well made for the genera. It is shot on film {not video tape}. The scenery is professionally done and the acting level reaches that of daytime soap operas. The sound quality is not bad. So the technical qualities are there to be transfered to DVD, just beware of the content."
Positive	close encounters of the sexy kind: As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. Until the night it happened. It turns out excessive probing can be quite painful, not to mention humiliating. Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up.
Negative	"What a waste: I had the movie before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the ""Flyboys Game"" I thought I would buy it off the market place. Good seller, but the DVD did not come with the game as advertised. It only came with a DEMO version of the game. They should have said that on the box. Thanks a bunch for false advertisement. Thought the other extras might make up for it, WRONG! Don't waste your time or money."
Negative	"pretty awful: I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
Positive	"Well Worth Watching: Like the movies ""Titanic"" and ""The Great Escape"", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the ""Lafayette Escadrille"". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen ""The DaVinci Code"" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."
Negative	completely disappointing: I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This cliché-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead.
Negative	Terrible - I walked out of this movie: When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype.
Negative	A movie or a music video??: What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser.
Positive	Romanticism and Reality: All the elements of a great movie. What can I say, I love to study the elements of war, and I enjoy a good love story along the way. This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie.
Positive	High Flying Adventure: This movie is very fun and entertaining. It does slow down quite a bit at times developing the subplots, but even two solid hours of nothing but action would get monotonous and boring.It explores the bravery, sacrifice, and even politics exemplified by so many in so many wars. In this case it is WWI. It is the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, among the very first fighter pilots, as they take on the Germans. There is lots of action, great cinematography, a good plot, and a love story as well.Despite any inaccuracies with the aircraft in this movie, it is nothing that a non-expert would notice. The flying scenes may be CGI, but it is done very well. A very enjoyable movie.
Negative	Another computer generated teen brain flick: The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can't watch this thing....You can not fly next to each other and yell back and forth between aircraft... They had hand signals for that... the story line is far from historical... I guess is Ok as a highschool date movie...
Positive	great movie: i thought it was a very entertaining movie, should have gotten more press when it came out. very good acting also
Positive	"WWI movie review: This was an excellent movie that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized.) There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual ""composite characters"" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a ""team,"" but this was better than most. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I reserve those ratings for the truly outstanding movie that comes along rarely."
Negative	"Is There A Cliche That Wasn't Used?: This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
Negative	"Ho Hum Effort: Fair representation of what could have been a great "" dog fight"" movie.The movie should have been edited down to less than 2 hours withoutalot of the frivolities that occur on the ground. You could still buildenough out of the characters to make them interesting without the prolonged love story. The action in the air is decent."
Positive	Flyboys (Collector Edition): The movie has 8.5 calification, the special effect are very good, in this new time of best movies, this movie its the first movie about the First World War; the DVD has 8.7 calification, god presentation, the postal pictures from the movies are good, the extras from the movie are good.My final calification is 8.7, is a very good movie, the scense and the flow of the story is good.Please buy this title
Negative	"What A Bust----Don't Waste Your Money: I'm glad I didn't go out and buy this movie. Thankfully, I just rented it. It starts out moving very slow, which some movies do. However, this movie never ""gets going"". The plot does not flow well, the actors lines don't always fit in to the scene, the background music does nothing for the movie, & there is a love side story thrown in for good measure. The computer animation of the air battles is the only good thing about this movie. My wife & I both watched it together. We both did not enjoy it. While watching the movie I actually thought about just ending the movie early. My advice, rent it before you buy it!If you want to see good WWI movies, then watch: The Blue Max, Paths Of Glory, The Lost Battalion"
Negative	"Thank God for fast forward: I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!"
Negative	Flyboys: What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on?
Positive	pretty good wwi movie: they don't bother to make many wwi movies anymore, so i was excited to see this one. the script is admittedly not very good, and the performances were kind of lame but they did not have good dialogue to work with. despite this i still enjoyed watching the movie as the combat sequences were very very realistic and had wonderful sound. it is great to finally see combat the way it probably really happened and feel adrenalin pumping. i thought that one scene in the howard hughes movie with decaprio got this across, and this movie continues what that scene suggested. too bad whoever wrote the script was not very smart or this could have been a classic.
Positive	"Fly Boys Lafayette Escadrille,movie for Plane lovers!!: The ""experts"" always!! This movie is enjoyable,the air battle scenes are very well done,story well told,it is for planes lovers not for history or movie ""experts"",the dogfights are fantastic!!I RECOMMEND for any plane Lover!!For the History ""experts"",Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, formerly the Marquis de La Fayette (or Lafayette) (September 6, 1757-May 20, 1834) was a former French aristocrat and military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions.He permanently renounced the title ""Marquis"" before the French National Assembly in June, 1790.)Lafayette served in the American War of Independence both as a general and as a diplomat, serving entirely without pay in both roles.Movies are for Entertainment!!I highly recommend this movie."
Negative	"Boring, don't waste your time: This movie is so boring. I was looking forward to it. But they bash America and the flying scenes look fake.Long boring love story that ends with both characters not finding each other.Rent or buy ""The Blue Max"" it's much better."
Positive	Almost great: I am not sure which movie all the critics were watching, obviously not the same one I was watching. Granted it could of been better in the development of characters but if they'd included the amount of detail some people would want then the movie would be as long as WW1. The computer generated dog fight scenes are great and keep you on the edge of your seat. It has its funny and sad moments but not too many dull moments. So if you're looking for a couple of hours of entertainment give it a try, if you're looking for a sickly love interest go and watch Titanic for the 50th time..
Positive	One Of The Best This Year !: After I watched this film I was ready to watch it again. This is a fantastic movie; if you love a great action packed film with a beautiful scenery and a wonderful story of courage, friendship and love. You will enjoy this film. With a love of history in it's truest form. Don't listen to the critics they never know what they are talking about I somtimes wonder if they even watch the films they talk about. Watch this film you will enjoy every sec. of it.
Negative	Flyboys! Don't think so: Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Planes don't fly that way. And the German guy is of course dressed in black and he's really bad. The hero becomes obsessed with getting even, and of course does. Most video games are superior to this sillyness. Total waste....
Negative	"Hollywood commercial film-making to the bone: Every possible cliche is here. The sound track smashes you in the head all the time. GCI battles cuks the life out of the movie. I'd prefer to watch again 1966's ""The Blue Max"" thatn ""Flyboys"".However, what makes this fil going and even somewhat tender to watch are the performances. There's some eracl acting here by James Franco and Jean Reno and the supoorting cast, even if they all clearly know this is an extremely commercial and cliched movie."
Negative	"Should been better: Nice actions, but if you looking for a more authentic WWI aerial combat drama try ""Der Rote Baron"" instead."
Positive	A great action-adventure film.: Flyboys has been severely critisized for being historically inaccurate. However, for all other reasons this is a great film. The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film. So if you don't worry about the historical inaccuracy, this is a film you will enjoy. Join me next time for my reveiw on the 2004 film National Treasure.
Positive	Good Buy: It isn't the best movie in the world, but it is definitely one that should be watched in HD with Surround Sound. It is a must for my library.
Negative	Have any of you who said this was good seen Blue Max?: Obviously by all the 5 star reviews who think the dogfight seens are great have never seen the Blue Max. This is what WWI airplanes flew like, not the cartoon in Flyboys. The only disapointment in the Blue Max is George Peppard is not german. Don't buy flyboys, watch it on cable.
Negative	"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting....: Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
Negative	A $1 rental: The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected.
Positive	best movie of the year: Its sad that the movie will only last a week or two in the theatres since it is a good rip roaring adventure that loosely follows the Lafayette Escadrille in WWI. The special effects are excellent, the planes and action appears to be real. If you get a chance see it on the big screen, it will lose a lot on video
Negative	You've got to be kidding me!: Well, let's not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible movie. Being an Air Force veteran, I like movies with planes, old and new, but I have to tell you this wasn't one of them. Acting was poor for the most part, historical aspects, well they get a grade of F-, including the planes, and supposed time period. All wrong. I usually like to watch a movie, and enjoy it, without analyzing it, but this one was different, and I could not help myself. I kept hoping it might get better, but no luck. So, Nothing ventured, Nothing gained, and I would not recommend this film to anyone! Period! Adios!
Negative	"Save Your Money: Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"
Negative	this is the funniest movie i've ever seen: i watched this movie and thought it was hilarious i didnt go five minutes without laughing. I loved all the random animals that kept popping up, and i especially loved the way the french chick instantly started talking like a mongoloid while she was learning english. At the end i couldn't take away one good thing from this movie. It is just terrible
Negative	"CRITICS GOT THIS ONE RIGHT!!!!: This movie was so awful, I felt compelled to warn others NOT to rent it & certainly not to buy it. Sorry, but this was a stinker. The battle sequences were OK, but they weren't enough to overcome the shallow & predictable ""plot""--there were these incredibly long, boring stretches where the cardboard characters kind of looked at each other and muttered horribly cliche, stale dialogue. It didn't try to be realistic; I found myself going ""Oh yeah, right"" countless times. This really is a waste of time & money. save yourself!!!Or dont say that I didnt tell you."
Positive	"The Sky is the Limit: The true story of the Lafayette Escadrille comes to life in MGM's action packed war movie ""Flyboys"" The young american men who fought for the French and became the first fighter pilots during the Great War. It's one of the best war movies ever made, a thrill ride into history, the best WWI movie since ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" It's spectacular, a great war film. See ""Flyboys"""
Positive	"EXCITING & ENTERTAINING ! FORGET THE CRITICS !: While this film may not win an academy award the aerial fighting sequences make it well worth the money ---plus the acting from relatively unknown actors was not bad at all----Those people who tout all the films historical errors tis IS a fictionalized account of Lafayette Escadrille how many of the critics especially some of the women critics have even heard of this name before? --Name one WW1 aviation film that has gotten it all correct you can't --""The Blue Max one of my favorites had pilots pulling on some sort of handle to fire their machine guns (all wrong) and had lozenge camouflage on the Fokker Triplanes which was also wrong --there is plenty wrong but I still loved the Blue Max as I love this film too---Maybe director Peter Jackson (King KONG) (who is rumoured considering) remaking the BLUE MAX WILL GET ALL THE SMALL DETAILS RIGHT AND ALSO make a kickass film that even the critics will have to love! Go see FLYBOYS You will be entertained!"
Negative	"Painfully fake: For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
Negative	A truly bad movie: Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.
Positive	Overall purchase: I wasn't sure what to think of the movie since I remembered hearing little about it. But it has become one of my favorite movies, especially war movies that try to tell some real truth about the time frames they cover. The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would. I believe the movie is excellent. The DVD arrived two days earlier than expected, so the seller gets a solid A, not only for speed of shipment but for speed of receipt. DVD in perfect condition.
Positive	Visually Stunning: I loved the Movie, it has everyting Great direction, Stunning visuals, Good looking cast, Great locations, Superb arieal fight scenes, Awesome Blu Ray picture & sound quality..Other than some great action, it covers Romance, Friendships & some more..pssst now thats for you to watch & find out!!
Negative	"What a Lemon: I ordered Flyboys because I had seen stills of the replica Neuports and they looked fantastic! As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of ""the skunk of the year award"" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that? Will we ever find out?Well for me The Blue Max towers above this movie despite being over 40 years its senior. Flyboys is a dog worse than Pearl Harbour yes we have the technology but that cannot make up for a very poor and purile script and wooden acting."
Negative	Be Forwarned!!!: I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like.
Positive	"Flyboys: The acting and aircraft sequences are very good. I enjoyed the movie, but if it is based on a true story, then I would have to read it. I found the ending a bit ""hoakey"". If you like WWI movies, like ""The Blue Max"", you will enjoy this one."
Positive	FLYBOYS: I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.
Negative	"Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else: This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
Positive	If you're a student of the first air war...you'll love this.: Super sound and visuals bring WWI air combat to life. For 90 years, the story of the first aces & fighter-planes has been limited to our imaginations, grainy pictures and mediocre films. Based on a true story with plenty of artistic license, Flyboys is fun to watch. An enjoyable story that puts the moviegoer in the cockpit. After watching this, you'll respect those Flyboys and be glad you weren't in the cockpit! The DVD is crisp, the audio great, the flying scenes spectacular, the story good.
Positive	FLYBOYS SOARS! Blu ray review.: Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!
Positive	Fly Boys: A very good account of WW1 flying aces. With a story line added to keep interest it realisticly accounts our early participation in WW1. With violent content viewers should be aware that it is not suited for younger viewers.
Negative	Save Your Money: I'm sorry I ever purchased this movie. Eddie Rickenbacker must be rolling over in his grave. Absolutely no relationship to reality. An insipid story line and unrealistic special effects. If you want a good WWI movie, go with All Quiet on the Western Front (with Lew Ayers) or the Blue Max (with George Peppard). Forget this drival.
Negative	Might make a good coaster: I went to see this in the theater and myself and two friends could not go the distance. We walked out before it was over. The plot is ridiculous and the acting does not make up for it.
Negative	"Crap.: Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
Positive	Excellent aviation movie: No it doesnt have A list actors in it but some are recognizable. The plot is entertaining. What makes this move a must see is the dawn of avation and combat tied into one movie. If you even remotely have an interest in military aviation, buy this movie.
Positive	The story is a bit campy, but the flying scenes are excellent!: This is a movie that does a great job of using CGI to create some awesome scenes. Despite the formula plot and silly side-show drama, the flying scenes make this movie worth watching over and over.
Positive	Remembering old times: The music is just as I remember it! It brings back so many memories... The only disappointment, is that is not 100% digital, it has been recorded from a long play, and you can still hear the needle going on the disc. Besides that is perfect!
Positive	Tight Dope: Dude, this CD is all sick! It is so totally awesome, you MUST buy it. The songs each have a unique sound, and personally I don't think any of them suck. They're all so happy!!! And the people who don't like this CD can suck it. So, if you don't wanna be a nark, buy this CD. Yo! Whaddup New Mexico? (Yes, it is part of the United States)
Negative	"This is not ""98 Degrees that play their own instruments""!: What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
Negative	"Sheesh, pull kids away from the radio!: I don't own this, which is surprising because I love to ""discover"" new acts. You want to know why I didn't buy this? I don't think they should even be allowed to sell this garbage! ""When I get you all alone, I'm gonna take off all your clothes, ain't nobody gonna interupt my game."" I couldn't believe that a song like that could make it onto the airwaves. I know you'll make fun of ""Genie In A Bottle,"" but I don't care, it's innocent and cute when a girl does it. When a guy sings stuff like this, I want to throw a rock at 'em!"
Positive	"This is one of my all time favorite cd's!: I absolutely love this cd. It reminds me of the 80's music I grew up on. When I first heard ""Ooh it's kinda crazy"" I did think it was George Michaels and I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this cd that Soul Decision is talented enough to write their own lyric's I don't think there is a song on this cd that I don't like. This cd puts me in a good mood, if you can appreciate a good love song and enjoy easy listening music with a pop and funky beat this cd is for you! I hope they come out with another cd soon."
Positive	Souldecision's a hit!: Hey,I have been lucky enough to meet Trevor(blond spiky hair and lead singer) Dave-brown hair, Ken(other blond plays keyboards and they are very nice guys! Their cd is also good, especially Let's Do It Right, Faded, Ooh It's Kind of Crazy. If you like pop with a beat to it definately SD is for you!
Positive	The Bomb: this cd is the bomb that has great songs like fadded, stay, and gravity. this is an awsome CD so buy it or u made a bad decison so by No one Does it better by soulDeicion
Positive	"Great album: For anyone who considers them in the ""boyband"" category, they were around making (playing the instruments, and writing the songs) their music long before the current craze; besides, if it's all about the music, it's a different sound, though still firmly in pop. Most of the CD flows pretty easily, the lyrics actually say something, and avoid ""bad/sad""-type cheesy rhymes. Faded and No One Does It Better are far and away the best, but that doesn't mean the others aren't good. Looking for a strong sophomore effort to keep Canada on the music map.. (I know Vancouver puts everyone in a good mood, but maybe next time with more than one song in a minor key!?)"
Positive	Needed in every Brio railway layout: This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size. The male-male and female-female pieces will provide a dramatic increase in the number of layouts possible as you can now overcome the problem of curves returning to the starting position.This is a must-have for any Brio enthusiast.
Positive	religious guides: I am impressed with the language and content of the Missionary Pal: Reference Guide> I did not expect to see references from several religions, but was glad they were mentioned. This way I gained a better understanding thru comparison.
Positive	Great Item!: We were so excited to get this item. We have a missionary out right now and he requested it about 9 months ago but we had no success in finding it. UNTIL NOW! I haden't even thought of looking on Amazon. Great shipping and our missionary is finding this to be very handy. Thankyou!
Negative	Bias Shows Through: While this book is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. If this book were to be shared with people of non-Mormon faiths, they would become very defensive and rightly so. The author's invective toward the Catholic faith is appaling. Many Mission Presidents do not recommend this book. It could be dangerous in the hands of the untrained.
Negative	"THESE COME AS ONE PAIR, & NOT 3 PAIRS AS PICTURED!!: I'm sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed...my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price. I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and ""false advertising"", as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price. Hope I enjoy the socks, but thought I'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you'll receive."
Positive	Great Socks: I wear these socks on a daily basis and I am very happy with them. They are about the only pair I've found that will actually stay up on/above my calves for any period of time.
Positive	Gold Toe is the Gold Standard: Love these socks from Gold Toe. They last and they are well made. Most of my socks are Gold Toe.
Positive	fab book for cowboy gear: This book is fascinating for its images & history for me the Aussie, we just dont have these cowboy suits in our history, & as a sewer who makes cowboy shirts in Oz, it interested me greatly, I got a 2nd hand ex library book & it was mint. Seems like an invaluable keeper to me.
Negative	they have taken a step back: i was also excited about buying this game only to find out that the people at visual concepts had taken a big step back. i was a fan of the series on dreamcast and had easily handed it the best basketball game of 2000 - 2002. well i purchased this game 4 days ago and haven't found a way to play more than 10 minutes total. to me the graphics look no better on gamecube than it did on dreamcast. second of all the gameplay ... the dunks look worse, the post play is horrible and the high lob passes will drive you crazy...the menus are confusing also. i don't think nba live 2003 is the answer but this game doesn't do it for me either. play 2k2 and save your money.
Positive	This game rocks!: Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!
Positive	Completely amazing!: The signer's voice is wonderful and the beat gets you moving. The lyrics are very sweet too. Between 2:06 and 2:48 there's an excellent beat rising and then it goes on with the moving beat. Any trance lover got to listen to that! :) I know some may say it's quite cheesy because of the vocals but I think it's a very good song on overall.
Negative	Dry and Humorless: I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars.
Negative	Booooring!!: This game is way to easy. The camara gets all twichi and there's not enough weapons.There are some cars that may be impossible to unlock(I think that way because you need to get to mission #18).I highly reccomend to rent it before buying it.
Negative	Saperstein is a no talent: He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. Quick with the headline but totally lacking in content.A suit devoid of body and soul .
Positive	The best of Raymond Chandler: This book, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book! Read The Long Goodbye, then read it again. This is not just a great mystery, but it is also great literature.
Negative	Long drawn out...all over the place!!!!: I saw this movie at the UMFF. It was toooo long. It was into 67 mins and still haven't got to the point. The storylines ...well so are all over the place. I would recommend putting on this movie if you have insomia. Trust me it will put you to sleep
Positive	Energetic, Tantelizing, and Spiritually Moving!: Wendy Rule has done it again, with this release. Her writing style, and vocals give her music a unique and undescribable sound. Anyone who has been searching for Wiccan/Pagan music artists will be delighted. For those who aren't Wiccan or Pagan, her music is sweet no matter what!
Positive	Sorry Wendy: I would have given this album a 5 had I not heard Zero first, but then nothing beats a live performanceBB
Positive	Music for the 21st Century: This is one fantastic CD.The combination of musicians that are on this CD take the music to another place. I am a big Miles Davis fan and first heard of Jason Miles when I got TuTu many years ago.On this Cd he has managed to create a musical universe that I have not heard on a CD for quite sometime. It's funky,lush,melodic,hard hitting and has the musical integrity that many Cds that try to be commercial don't have.I played this for my 17 year old son and he just loved it.The music has the ability to speak to alot of different audiences and age groups.I love the track Voices on The Corner. It's music that I've never heard before.I agree with the reviewer here who can't figure out why Jason Miles isn't a household name. Hopefully this CD will change that
Positive	I finally found a book I can understand: I have read this book slowly and thoughtfully, letting Jesus' words sink in. This book has helped me to really grasp much of what Jesus meant in his stories. I will read this again and again.
Positive	Easy to read, packed with wisdom: I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Parables. I didn't expect this book to be overflowing with facts on jewish culture. Gary does an excellent job describing the context for each parable. Gary picked essential parables and truly helps you understand what Jesus meant. One nice surprise is Gary's theological application. If you like books that flow but have a deeper teaching then you should buy this book. Let this book be a deeper devotional or a study tool for your next teaching on a parable. I promise you will be inspired and encouraged by Gary's interpretation of the Parables.
Positive	Excellent read!: I've given three or four away for others to read... If you enjoy the parables you'll definitely want to get this book...
Positive	"The Parables Review: As a Precepts on Precepts student doing a 23 lesson study on Matthew, I thought this would be a good book to help understand Jesus' parables better. Kay Aurthur advocates letting scripture interpret scripture. The author of ""The Parables"" did a nice job, but I guess I was looking for more indepth analysis of the various parables. I would recommend this book; it is an easy read and does give a lot of information about the parables. Maybe if I were to read it a second time I'm sure I would get more out of the book. It's like reading the bible, you are always discovering a truth that you did not see before."
Positive	Beautiful: This movie is just brillant! Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fabulous. and Liv Tyler sparkles. Plunkett and Macleane had all elements of a memorable movie that you'll want to watch again and again!
Negative	"""The Velvet Goldmine"" with wigs and panniers: The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad. Pretty costumes, pretty direction, a nifty techno soundtrack, and Robert Carlyle make watching Plunkett & McLeane worthwhile only if you're in the mood for a ninety-minute music video. Brainless fun."
Negative	"To waste time only.: If, according to the editorial review, you either desire to lavish the director of this picture with affection or to slap him silly, I advocate the latter. An amateurish attempt to lend some ""hipper than thou"" gloss to a mediocre plotline. Even the actors themselves seem uninspired by the material. Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."
Negative	Pretentious and Predictable: There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair.
Negative	One of the worst movies EVER !!!!: I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film.
Positive	A Real Sleeper: Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate.
Positive	Pleasently Surprised: I bought this movie on a whim, knowing that two of my favorite actors were in it, but also knowing it had not done well in the theatres and that one of my LEAST favorite actresses was in it. However, after viewing this movie, I'm shocked at how good it was. The music threw me at first, but I soon got into the mood. Knowing that Ridley Scott's son directed this movie also gives it merit. I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!
Positive	A new old fantasy: A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it.
Positive	Beautiful Photos, Great Info: I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this book. It has some great pictures to help you identify birds, or even just to look at. The book doesn't stop there, however, it gives you nice detailed information of bird behavior, sounds, nests and habitat. I recommend this book to beginner or intermediate bird watchers.
Negative	"TeddyBears: Okay...........I'll admit that The TeddyBears got a good hit in ""CobraStyle"".........however, someone out there please reference me back to a hit from the 60's or 70's that has the same beat and melody and a lot of organ and drums.Please...............it is driving me crazyTed in the Sanitarium Lobby"
Positive	"Techno with a twist: A group that's fairly unknown in the south but worth a listen. You may remember their song, ""PUNKROCKER"" a few years back on a Cadillac commercial."
Positive	"Captures a certain amount of Zeitgeist: Disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of music, inasmuch as I prefer rock and adult contemporary. After hearing the appetizer ""Cobrastyle"" as a current staple of the alternative radio realm, I was anxious to see the full menu. I also heard an interview of the three core band members from Stockholm about 3 weeks ago.The album is an eclectic mix of techno pop, shining brightest when showcasing the irresistible thumping dance rhythms. The overall experience brought back a certain frenetic dance energy I haven't felt in over 10 years. Overall, I am very glad I bought it. I expect it will be a hit at any party. Turn the volume up and let loose!The highlights for me are ""Cobrastyle"", ""Different Sound"", and ""Little Stereo."""
Positive	My new favorite record: I saw these guys at Coachella last year and not only do they put on an amazing performance, there studio work is nothin short of superb. This is definitely an album you can put on and listen from track 1 until the very end and get into every minute! All my buddies are hooked!
Positive	"Oh my gosh....: This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read."
Positive	Very Different From Jaffe's Usual: The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book.
Positive	Now I want to meet them: This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani & Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!
Negative	"Hostel is better, but not by much.: i'll make my review short on this movie. it took 59 minutes to get to the ""good stuff"" and there wasn't much at that. you've seen all this before. no shock value here."
Negative	"Great in theory....horrible in execution: They had a great idea with this film (despite clearly borrowing the concept from ""Hostel"")...a group of stranded tourists in Brazil are drugged and robbed and left with no alternative but to follow a ""friend"" into the jungle, ostensibly to have their organs sold on the black market, unbeknownst to them.What failed was just about everything from the horrible acting, to the gratuitous bikini-clad ""Hostel"" wanna-bees, to the implausibility of their situation and the fact that a horror film should actually be scary. Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it. If you like the idea behind the film, ""Hostel"" is a much better take on the could-it-really-happen-to-me-as-a-traveler-in-a-foreign-country horror film."
Positive	Intense: I love how this movie shows the two extremes of Brazil; the beauty and the beast so to speak of touring a country that has extremely lovely beach and jungle areas, but also bleak areas of poverty where corruption and crime ruin lives. Great concept for a movie, and very well written and filmed in my humble opinion. I really appreciated the cave/water scenes, since they are often so difficult to do. The action gets intense, and some scenes are pretty gruesome (don't eat your dinner in front of this film if you have a weak stomach), but I really loved the story and acting. This is a tale that makes you 'think' about some of the horrid things going on in the world and the chain reaction of greed.Chrissy K. McVay - Author
Positive	Hot women and freaky moments: I don't get why this movie isn't more popular. It's got a good cast, many hot women in little to nothing, and a slasher plot that's entertaining. I mean it's not a 5 star worthy movie, but what horror movie is? Stephen King's IT, maybe?
Positive	Could Really Happen: A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better movie than Hostel. First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot. Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary. The acting is good, the tension and thriller elements are good and even the scenery is good. It is very gory though, so if you cannot stand the blood, get out of the jungle operating room.
Negative	Stay far,far away from this garbage: This movie is so haorrible its not even funny.its very slow movie,the acting is bad,all of the good action takes place at the end and before you know it its all over before you got a chance to even enjoy it.if you are looking for this type of film watch any of the saw movies or the two hostel movie...all of which are better then this.trust me dont even rent this.i got it for $5.99 and felt cheated.a fair warning to all those considering this....DONT DO IT to yourself.
Negative	2 stars for 2 scenes: 1 girl running off cliff and 1 girl still awake while being operated on (creepy).other than those scenes,its basically the son of hostel.
Negative	Not a great movie!: I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
Negative	It's like watching the show LOST!: Is it just me or did I feel like I was watching a missing episode of the show Lost? Just kiddin but anyways I thought it was a lil like the show Lost a bit but this movie was horrible. Do not watch it!
Negative	Humbug!: This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Not my sort of thing, so I probably never should have bought it in the first place.
Positive	Turistas: This turned out to be a really good movie! I actually saw this movie for sale in Blockbuster for $5 months ago, but after reading the description of it, chalked it up to being another edition of Hostel. Only recently when it came on cable did I realize that it is much, much better than Hostel.
Negative	Just Awful: Horrible acting, worse plot...the only thing it has going for it is some good looking ladies, but even they can't make the film worth watching. Save 2 hours of your life and avoid this movie.
Positive	Better than Hostel !! Check it out !: Surely, Hostel pushes gore into new level. But to be honest I think Turistas is slightly more realistic than Hostel. A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.If you like Hostel, this one is no brainer but even if you don't like Hostel, you may still like this one as this is better than HOSTEL.
Negative	suckfest: if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring...
Negative	Um....Hostel anyone?: This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such. I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel. This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares. This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick. The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable. I'm sorry I wasted my time.
Negative	"horrible: this movie was just plain bad. bad story. bad ""gore"". bad everything. don't waste your money or your time watching this."
Negative	"Trashstas!!!!!!!: For reasons I'll never understand, someone at work gave me this ""movie"" to watch because they said I would like it. WRONG,WRONG,WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is is just one long and sick snuff film of the lowest order. Many will like it but it really worries me that this disturbing thing is listed as Entertainment. Igrew up with slasher movies and they were call all kind of things in there time, but this one is truly just sick."
Negative	Low Budget: Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans.
Positive	"A good movie but not a horror film: If you're going to buy ""Turistas"" expecting to see a Hostel"" Eli Roth"" type film ...Your not going to,What you will see is a good, well acted, action packed movie with pretty people, beautiful scenery and some blood ""not much"" but the premise is not Horror it's more like the vacation from hell.Over all I liked this movie and recommend it for someone not looking for a hard core horror or gore film but just a good suspenseful action movie."
Negative	"Um...NO.: Ok I hate to burst anyone's bubble about this movie...but it says on the cover ""A better and scarier movie than Hostel"". Um...NO. I actually enjoyed it up to the point where they got into the house and it got dark. From that point on the movie took place in nothing but darkness and you could not tell what was happeneing or who was who. So so annoying. This movie pissed me off. Don't waste your money. Thank god I only paid a few bucks for it. A complete waste of time. Eww."
Positive	I love this movie, and josh jackson looks real good.: i liked the movie cuz the guy that was sayin all that stuff..forgot his name...the 1 with red hair...he reminds me of a friend, and i really enjoyed all 3 of the movies.
Negative	"The Movie That Spawned An NHL Franchise: Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid's flicks. Well, it was good for what it was. I wouldn't watch it again though, it wasn't as memorable as ""The Sandlot"" or ""Goonies"" but it'll do."
Positive	Hockey! We love Hockey!: This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie. If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!
Positive	A Film From My Childhood: I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me. I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it. The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment. Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey. When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there. This film is a laugh a minute with childish humour that still makes me laugh now
Negative	uhmmm: I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.
Positive	young hockey fans: My 6 yr old grandson loves movies on my kindle fire--and hockey fans of all ages in our family love the mighty ducks. this movie is becoming a classic, plus ordering movies on kindle fire is fast and easy. we saw this movie in a theater years ago, and it is just as fresh and fast paced and as much fun on the small screen as it was in a movie theater. He and I watched this together, and laughed a lot.
Positive	Good Family Movie: This movie had funny parts, and a good lesson for kids: Don't take your life too seriously, have fun once in a while. You win just by having fun.With that moral in mind, the movie is one that is appropriate for all ages. There is some mild mischief in the movie, but the language never crosses the mild PG range. If you enjoy goofy movies with a fun ending, this movie is for you.
Positive	Good hockey movie: Good story line for a hockey movie. Fun for the kids to watch and always a good one to bring up when you are around high school hockey players. A movie that all kids have seen in their lives if they enjoy watching hockey.
Positive	You don't have to know hockey: One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment.
Positive	"Family-Friendly Hockey Fun: If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called ""The Bad News Bears on skates,"" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)"
Negative	What Happened.: Ray J Ray j Ray j whats goin on this album is crap theres about 3 songs with good beats on em but ray j's vocals just screw them up. theres nothing great about this album or ray j.
Negative	"What happened to this man?: I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."
Negative	"Please make it stop!!!: I'm sorry but Ray J can't sing worth a damn. Everytime ""One Wish"" comes on the radio I have to change the station - it's too painful to listen to. I can't believe they let that one get past the studio...please make it stop!!"
Negative	"Career Advice Ray J:Avoid a Recording Studio: aside from the Fact that I was only trying to get the Cut He did with R.kelly""Quit Actin"", I wasn't paying this cat no musical mind.Ray J is vocally tone challenged.he can't make up His Mind who is attempting to jack as a Singer.One Minute He wants some R.kelly,then Usher,Omarion,etc...Problem is dude ain't much of a Singer.so i was surprised to hear any Record Company was actually gonna give Him a solo deal.but anyway I got the song I wanted&tunned out the rest.maybe if He is lucky he can get a gig on the UPN network.wait a minute I heard he got something linned up well stick to it&stay out of the Music lab."
Positive	Ray-J has grown up.....: I'm feeling this album. He has really stepped his game up a lot. The intro on the song is even hott.My favorites would have to be One wish, Keep sweatin',Lets play house, Melody, Sexy, Anytime, and What I need. The songs I didn't really care for are Unbelievable I don't like that song. Exotic I thought the song would be different. and War is over even though Rayj and Brandy collabos are usually hott I ain't feeling this song on this album.
Negative	He's not quite there yet...: Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!
Negative	"This is horrible: Out of the whole cd Ray J has just good song called ""One Wish"" the cd is a mixture of songs that don't make sense and he shouldn't be singing. I would not recomend this cd to anyone."
Negative	If I had one wish...: Amazon would allow us to vote using negative stars. While we're on the subject of radiation, maybe chemotherapy would be less painful and traumatic then listening to this garbage.
Positive	Ray J Stepped His Game Up: I don't care what anybody says this album is tight..Its a cd you can play from the beginning to the end..We all know Ray J does not have the best voice infact he can't sing at all, but give the man some credit he did his thang on this album..I don't get why it didn't sell cause in my opinion it should be on the top ten charts its very underrated..So if you wanna listen to some REAL r & b music then pick this album up.
Negative	"WHY?: Ray J is not a thug... This as well as his image is all a FRAUD. It's insufferable listening to all his whining. Even R. Kelly's presence on ""Quit Actin'"" and Mya on ""Sexy"" are not enough to save this garbage. Ray J take a hint and ""Quit Actin'"" yourself and while you are at it stop singing too."
Negative	"If i had one wish...: I'd make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. ""If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish..."". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song."
Negative	"Pure Rated Garbage.(PRG): THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
Positive	"The World Ain't Ready 4 Ray J: This album is one of Ray J's finest works. It's gritty and it's honest. His vocals are REAL. When you're a true artist you understand that making a song is not always about hitting the 'right note"". It's about the feeling behind the lyrics. The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview"" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience. Overall the album is worth every penny you spend because it sounds nothing like the regular mindless stuff you hear clogging up the airwaves today."
Positive	I love it Ray J has soul!: I love this cd so much! hes really grown up hes only about a year older then me but hes still sexy and he can sing sing sing i love the majority of his cd i love blue high heels melody one wish and war is over featuring his sister brandy hes stepped his game up and hes not a little boy anymore so if you like rnb and good sounding music go out and cop this cd its a real slow jam banga! im lovin it! hes so so sexy now too hes grown up and i think his cd is underated by most people so if you like soul and rnb and hip hop all rolled into one you will love this cd i guarantee you'll be playing it on the regular i know iam! its one of my favorites! love it love it he has such a great vocal range and a great body too :-) so if you like soulful great fun love music get this cd and stop hatin on the brotha for makin some good tunes that you can really groove to cause im lovin it i give it all 5 stars!
Positive	I knew!!!!!!: I knew he would do it. it is long over due for people to stop looking at Ray J as Brandy's little brother and as his own individual person i give this album five fat stars i like this whole cd but my favorite song is Melody and it's exactly about the title I love this song too because I am a singer too and I love music so i get where he is coming from this song is beautiful!!!!!!
Negative	"Noise Pollution: Every time I hear that song ""One Wish"" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD."
Negative	"Not worth it: And I only paid $23 for it. Thankfully the boys at Alternate Universe in Milford, CT are decent people and let me exchange it for a book of Krazy Kat.I'm a pretty huge fan of Spiegelman's work. I even have ""Breakdowns"", published in 1977, NOT 1997 like this book seems to believe!Aside from other errors, it was largely padded. He spent nearly a page explaining what the Holocaust was. Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's. It also was a fairly extensive summary of the history of comic art, but that's not exactly why a person would buy this book.Sorry Mr. Forget, but I was unimpressed."
Negative	Not as described: Package says one size fits most queen...well what the heck is most queen because a 1x and a 3x are too different sizes, I am a 1x and this didn't fit over my curves.
Positive	good stuff: the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
Positive	Want more: An interesting experiment.Great subject, great acting, great sound.Too short however, and too short presence of my beloved Zara.Awaiting more...The DVD also contains beautiful interviews with Ian Hart, Stephen Lord and Elaine Cassidy (a delight for the fans of her.)[...]
Negative	"Dead On Arrival: Normally, I would never buy anything from Harman Kardon. But this DVD player was on sell for $100.00 from $300.00. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. I set up the player and placed my first DVD in it. I knew I was in trouble when I hearding a whining, grinding sound. That wasn't too amusing. What was even less amusing was the nice blank TV screen. I tried another DVD just to make sure it wasn't a problem with the DVD. I got the same whining, grinding sound and blank TV screen.It wasn't worth mailing back, in either time or money. I went down to the local Best Buy and bought myself a nice Sony DVD player. It has been working great.I'm waiting to take my HK DVD player outside and re-enact the scene from ""Office Space"" where the guys beat the crap out of the printer. ;-)"
Positive	The Most Understated Guitarist of our Time: Blues Saraceno is nothing short of a demi-god when it comes to musical genius. His approach to music in it's entirety is amazing to say the least. He has replaced my past favorites and now stands proud at the top. While he is fast as Vai and Satriani, his phrasing is majestic. His tone in unprecedented and unmatchable. Surprising to say, Saraceno cut all of these tracks in his own home studio at the ages of 16-23. You will understanding what I am talking about when you hear this albumn. BUY THIS CD!!! REVEL IN ITS BEAUTY!!! SPREAD THE WORD OF BLUES SARACENO!!!
Positive	GREAT,GREAT,GREAT!!!!!: There should be a warning label cautioning drivers not to listen and drive. You'll get lost in the beat and end up with a ticket! FIVE STARS ISN'T ENOUGH !!
Positive	"Magum's finest?: Magnum's ""Vigilante"" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!"
Positive	"This could be the best yet...: In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
Positive	Quiet Nights: Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves
Positive	"Bebel Gilberto does it again!: Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best. After her previous releases I thought to myself ""Well it cant get better than this"" and while maybe I can't say she has improved this is still up there with the rest of her releases.Soft vocals over an almost African rhythm that just blend together so well. Yeh this is quality lounge music, this is music for the summer, long lazy days having a drink with friends, just being alone after a hard day or a long drive.Probably the only thing I dislike on this CD are when she sings in English. Give me that Portuguese any day!"
Positive	Yet another solid collection...: I wouldn't be at all surprised if this release, Bebel's third, receives mixed reviews. Its flaw is that the first two tracks are the weakest songs on the cd- hard to believe, I know...(and the 2nd track is the supposed 'hit single'). But starting with track 3, Close to You, through til the end, it's consistently strong, varied material, closer in spirit to Bebel's 2nd release, Bebel Gilberto, than Tanto Tempo: more focus on Brazilian music than electronica (though admittedly 'Cade Voce' does recall the insipidness of the opening two tracks). That said, there's none of the soaring intensity as on Bebel Gilberto: Memento, by comparison, is a rather laid-back, understated affair. Um Segundo- entirely acoustic and recorded live in a studio in nyc- is one of a handful of standout tracks, reminding me of how much I'd love to be back in Bahia...
Negative	"Disappointing: Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. Last two tracks (""Cade Voce"" and ""Words"")are almost noteworthy, but not quite! Save your money on this one unless your a collector. Oh well - maybe next time."
Negative	A real disappointment: I stumbled upon Bebel at the bookstore with her first album. I rejoiced when I found a second and then when I listened to it could hardly keep myself away from it! If I had listened to this album first I would have dismissed Bebel immediately as not worthy of listening to. Her cut of Night and Day sounds like she is drunk and her instrumentalist joined in in the partying. There were a few good moments when the real Bebel seemed like she would make an appearance, but these quickly faded. I would not purchase a fourth CD without listening to it in its entirety first.
Positive	Good album: Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music. Though personally this isn't my favorite album that she's made, however the songs Momento, Close to you, Azul, and Cade Voce in my opinion are more of the rare gems Bebel has added to her already popular arsenal of great Bossa Nova music. Any true fan of hers would be satisfied with her overall performance of this album. Keep it up Bebel!!!!!
Positive	Ultra Force Field Jacket: The real deal. Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter. Field jacket, liner, and undersweater. 28 degrees and still comfortable. Great investment.
Positive	Fabulous customer service: Gomadic brand product does the job and seems well made. The Gomadic web site which provided customer service was top notch. I either misplaced or didn't receive the exchangeable tip for the AC charger. When I let them know they were more than helpful and I had a new tip in my hands almost instantly. A singular experience for me and I buy online often.
Positive	"The Teenage Tragedy Phenomenon: For some inexplicable reason teenage tragedy was a pop music phenomenon in the late Fifties and early Sixties and this single-disc collection hits all the highlights. ""Last Kiss"", ""Teen Angel,"" ""Endless Sleep,"" ""Tell Laura I Love Her,"" ""Patches"" and ""Leader of the Pack"" all went Top Ten, so apparently sad tales of adolescent woe weren't a detrement to chart success. The only real clunker here is the goofy parody ""Leader of the Laundromat."" [Surprisingly, that song went to No. 19, while ""Leader of the Pack"" was still on the charts.] If you like a good cry now and then--or just need to be reminded that not all pop hits were sunshine and rainbows--this album is for you. RECOMMENDED"
Negative	An example of silly science fiction: Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. The story opens with her taking her nieces and nephews to the fair and exhibiting her rock collection. There she meets Mr. Haggerty and gives him a ride. It turns out that Mr. Haggerty is to be the navigator on a space flight to Mars and the ship is currently parked in Miss Pickerell's pasture. This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue. I read this book for the first time when I was in elementary school and even then found it laughable. There are many books for the young person far superior in their descriptions of space flight.
Negative	Coffee Table Book - good for ideas but no plans or detailed design: If you're looking for a finnish fireplace design book, look on. This is a picture book showing how a finnish fireplace design can fit into home decor, containing not any plans or technical information. Disappointing.
Negative	"Not DVD Quality: I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up. In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light. It gets very annoying. There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie."
Negative	Meh...I've had better.: I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality.
Positive	Quality: This is a quality product. Brio puts out a great wooden train track. They are wooden, well made and have held up to many years of use at our home.The more different sizes and items you have for your track the more your track can change from a simple circle to a large fun track. We have several sets of these to play with at our home.I would probably buy these after I have bought some of the extension kits with the more specialized track pieces and after I had some of the smaller pieces available for purchase.Well worth the money.Enjoy.
Negative	Thomas the Train tracks: This is a good product, but highly over-priced. $10 for FOUR pieces of track ???????
Negative	"Not Moorcock's Best: Blood is a book that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Sadly it never focuses on any one of them long enough to become interesting. Too many elements seem to have been tossed in without having any impact on the story, stretching suspension of disbelief beyond all bounds. The attempt at ""non-linearity"" simply creates a jumble that, while ultimately having a certain underlying logic, is not a very entertaining or engrossing read."
Negative	"Mediocre: I have been reading Moorcock's work ever since I encountered his creations while playing RPGs in the early Nineties. Suffice it to say, Moorcock seems to have nothing more to add to his Chaos-spawned mythology other than an obviously mediocre book. Old hands will probably notice the allusions to the Eternal Champion, a concept which in all the circumlocutions ,Alas! almost put him at par with those lame ""formula writers"". His Blood just fails to churn mine."
Positive	Great Value Priced CD: Saw a TV Show not long ago with the Everly Brothers in concert and hadn't really ever though much about them, they were before my time. However, really liked them and I couldn't get the song, (Till) I Kissed You, out of my head. So I bought the CD for my girlfriend, come to find out they have a lot of songs that we liked and had heard, but never really paid that much attention too and didn't know that they sung them. It's a great CD for the money, but I do hate the Eco-Friendly Packaging.
Positive	"The BEST Everly Brothers album you will ever need,: Long ago in californialand, i heard the last everly brothers ""hit"", on the wings of a nightingale, 1 time and i knew I HAD to have it. Took me about 20 years to find it, in this album. If you really like good music, with tight harmonies, good guitar work, words you can understand, a little bit of country and early rock to the still bitchin, fresh,updated sound of nightingale, then STOP RIGHT HERE and get this album. Enough said!"
Positive	Everly Brothers: These brothers were early rock favorites of the teenage crowd - a kinder, gentler time. Most teens today would consider them boring, but their messages are still relevent, just to a younger group. I still love their music, and you can actually understand every word they say. Very catchy tunes, and even my granddaughters will play their cds occasionally (they're early twenties). I recommend this cd because it has all their best songs on it.
Positive	NBA 2k3 VS NBA 2003!!!!: Unlike the other reviewers, i'll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. I got BOTH!GRaphic-NBA2003 had better graphics, smoother movement and brighter textures.Sound-NBA2k3, cuz of ESPN!!!Value-2k3 hands down. I don't know why... but it last longer. and Online Play nuff said....Gameplay- 2003 is more casual friendly, which means even if you're not into Basketball you could still find some fun here. And with their innovative Freestyle right joystick control, its deffinitly funner.While 2003 could be funner for a shorter amount of time, 2k3 is the real winner if you took your time for Seasons.... Which one's better is really a matter of taste.
Positive	2K3: This is the same as playstation2 verison i love all ov the 2K's this has better graphics then playstation2 but this is a good gane overall.
Positive	Sega Sports Rules: Best basketball game out there...most realistic, challenging and fun...street games are a great addition
Negative	"Don't believe the hype.: The reason i bought this game was beause of all the great reviews from here and game web sites. All i hear was it's the best B-ball sim out there. Well that's a bunch of BS. I don't know how many times playing as kobe, Shaq, Iverson etc.. i've gotten my shot blocked (even on fade aways) by a bench player. As shaq i get a miss match with a 6foot guard so i try backing him down and well i can't. It seems shaq isn't strong enough to plow his way through a 6 footer lol. And when i make him spin to the basket then press shoot 9 times out of 10 he doesn't go for the dunk instead he throws up some off balance,fade away crazy looking shot. The gameplay is challenging but not in a good way. I guess i will try ""NBA Live""."
Negative	A complete piece of junk: This piece of equipment is aweful. It doesnt work period. Just look at the tech support webpage from ADS an be your own judge.
Negative	Piece of grabage - STAY AWAY!: I have about 20 hours invested in this thing. It DOES NOT WORK!I am running a new install of XP on a new Pentium 4.The only good thing about this package is the third party Ulead software that is included. As for the ADS software, I continue to get errors when I try to playback video:ADSTech CapWiz Application has encountered a problem and needsto close... This is the second PC I have tried to install this on, and it is the same story. I have followed the instructions over and over again. What a waste of time and money!
Negative	Does not work properly, COMPANY NO HELP: The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn't work properly. While converting: I am getting interference from the unit on both the TV and computer (which shows up on the copy), there is a 1/8 inch distortion at the bottom of the preview screen (also shows up on the copy), and the sound is not in sync. I tried to contact the company by phone and left messages instructed with no call back from them. Sent an email to tech support that went unanswered too. Finally contacted someone at the company, explained my problems, returned the unit as per instructions for repair, received it back after 3 weeks and it still doesn't work. Contacted tec support again and was told to download updated program(I had the latest version installed) did so anyway without any better results. My suggestion is to pass on this unit.
Negative	Problems with drivers and Syncing - Don't Buy: Drivers for XP gave trouble. Had fewer problems with Win ME.However, this baby has problems syncing sound and video. Check all forums on the web, this is a problem everyone has.Doesn't look like ADS is about to fix it any time soon.A definite DON'T BUY.
Negative	bad: Not happy with this product lots problems!!!Not work at all for me. Had a person who is computer nam look at it and everything. He not get it either.
Positive	ADS works fine...1st time: I had few problems installing these units on two different PC's. The CAPWIZ is somewhat flakey (V2.0) at timesand requires exiting and reentering the CAPWIZ program.I found this utility to work the best with the unit inplace ofthe Video Studio. Unit does a fine job in the capture process andcreates a presentable MPEG1 (SVCD,MPEG1,MPEG2)..I Found VCD resolution encoding to be less than ideal,
Negative	Good piece of hardware, C+ software, terrible tech support: This product is a good idea. However, the software is not easy to use. Unless you have a very powerful PC, and get installation right the first time, you'll be in trouble. Included documentation is of little help and Tech support is a dead end (not to mention arrogant).
Negative	Not for XP: I have a 1.7gig P4 running XP and found this product to be very unstable which is a nice way to say it doesn't work. The hardware would always hang my computer no matter which software I used with it. Also a note to their clueless tech support, my Maxtor hard drive was the cause for the sound and video being out of sync, when I reinstalled XP using a Western Digital drive the sync problem went away but not the instability. Believe Microsoft when they say use of an unsigned driver may make your system unstable.
Negative	Worst ever: I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. This is neither instant nor is it DVD. It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy.
Negative	Instant Piece of [junk] is more like it: I was unable to get the driver for Win XP Pro to work. When I had problems I went back, erased my drive and did a clean install of Win XP, twice. The second time I was very careful about the order in which I loaded the driver, but to no avail. The applications that came with it kept hanging and never worked. Instant DVD is a total piece of [junk]. I regret wasting this much time on a product that does not seem to have been tested with Win XP. I contract this with Pinnace's product. I installed Pimmance PCTV Pro and it was easy to install and works like a charm.
Negative	USBAV-700 Software Wouldn't Load: Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly. E-mail to company went unanswered, except for auto reply. Phone numbers were always busy. Returned the unit to the store of purchase for a refund.
Positive	Wonderfully inspirational!: If you've ever wondered *what if* about a past love, this is the book for you!! A GREAT read!!!
Positive	"Bravo!: Though some of the works here are better than others, such as ""Milagro"", and ""The Integral"", Ms. Pita offers enough of a variety with a master's stroke that most tastes will be satisfied."
Positive	Snapped right into my 03 Accord: This is a pretty good product. It fit nice and tight in the doors of my 2003 Accord without having to drill any holes. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to do some customization to get a tight seal around the speakers (5 1/4 in).
Negative	This one's a loser: Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice.
Negative	not that much of a heartache .,: When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it. This is the second book in the all-girl brands series it 's not as good,it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can't feel a whole lot of empathy for the character.THE HEROINE IS JUST SELF CENTRED AND BORING AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HERO SEE'S IN HER BESIDES THE FACT SHE IS A MODEL THE HERO DESERVED BETTER.
Positive	A comidy thriller: Jessie Woods,my great great Aunt, has had such a wonder and histerical life. Her facinating stories of her early life as a wing walker, have been put in a book that couldn't of been written any better. I would recomend this book to any one who is looking for a good laugh and some teeth gripping tales o walking on the wing.
Positive	Grat book!: A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
Negative	This is the worst hockey game!!: This is the worst hockey game made for this season. This game looks like it was made in the eighties! I rented Hitz and the gave me this by accident. I played it for about twenty minutes and i was so disgusted I didn't touch it again. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone except as a very last resort. After a bout five minutes of playing I had counted three animation glitches and five sound ones. This game was so horrible my family who doesn't know much about games even thought it was horrible. I have been to three rental stores and four different department stores and the highest and the highest anyone gave it was 4/10.
Negative	certains bugs viennent tout gacher: le jeu est bon mais comporte des bugs sur xbox live , les statistiques ne sont pas compiliees correctement sur xbox live. on perd la connection de temps a autre et une deconnection compte parfois pour une defaite... bon jeu a 1 joueur mais pas fort sur le live...
Negative	"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd: The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library ""Prepared by HP"". It is ""an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages."" My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99."
Negative	waste of money and time: I bought this cd and have been disappointed from day one. First of all, there are only 200 questions per section (5 sections) which means you will be through this cd in less than a weeks time....you'd be better off buyng the book set instead. As well, when you take the mock exams you will soon discover that they have cut corners once again and have recycled questions from the previous sections into the exam. This does not test your knowledge, it tests your ability to memorize. When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong, but be careful because once you quit the cd, all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again! All in all, i was thoroughly dissapointed with my purchase and would have been better off without it. By the way, i haven;t even written my board exam, so i am not blaming this cd for poor exam results...yet!
Negative	Couldn't get it.: I got no traction at all in this book. Was counting on a friend who also bought it and, sadly, his reaction was the same. I'm going to take another run at it.
Negative	Two discs won't play.: Discs 6 and 11 won't play. Big damaged spots, you can see through the discs. Humbly request replacement or refund.
Negative	"Ick!: I was expecting the author to continue with some Dickensian darkness and magical whimsey. The darkness was certainly delivered...and with heaping doses of vulgarity to boot. A dry read most certainly NOT reminiscent of the tone of ""A Christmas Carol""--as one is led to expect by the book's abstract--I stopped reading it after the fourth chapter and haven't missed it at all!"
Positive	Very imaginative and mysterious: Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Scrooge? Bayard answers that question in a very imaginative and mysterious way. Part historical fiction, part mystery, and part psychological thriller, this book is a wonderful read.
Positive	"Brilliant: I read this book over the summer and it was so good that I kept putting it down as I didn't want it to end! Dicken's ""Tiny Tim"" is now all grown up at 23 in 1860 and is living in a London brothel, where he teaches the mistress how to read and write in exchange for board. He discovers three dead girls that have died in an unusual way, and he sets out to find out how and why. Include a colourful cast that includes a street urchin and an Italian orphan, and you've got yourself a fantastic, brilliant read. It is easily one of the best books I've ever read."
Negative	avid reader: BORING. this book should have been a short story. i am shocked that people liked it so much.
Negative	"Tiny Tim in Adulthood: Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
Negative	one of the worst: This book was one of the worst I have ever read. I thought it was going to be inspiring on the life of Tiny Tim from The Christmas Carol story. Instead, it was raunchy, and totally boring. Shame on the reviewers who lured our book club with their praise of this book for the Christmas season. Couldn't even finish it - and I have never not finished a book in over 30 years. Blah!
Negative	Disappointing: Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back. I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting.
Positive	Couldn't put it down: Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. As a character, Mr. Timothy is drawn with a complexity that defies prediction of his actions. The two children he partners with feel true, with the charm and courage that Dickens gave the children he wrote about. One cares what happens to all of them, and I assure you, much does happen. I found myself savoring the last few chapters, dreading that time when I would reach the back cover and part company with this fascinating group.
Negative	"not really a memorable story: I read this book a couple of months ago and I cannot remember much about the book, it being totally forgetable. Mr. Timothy could be Mr. Fred. There wasn't much of a point to him being ""Tiny Tim"" - just a plain old story. A big disappointment."
Positive	Pea Pod Babies: The book was in great condition and it is a great story, but the seller neglected to include that their was a personal note inside the cover.
Positive	The Dutchman: I enjoy history and this historical fiction was terrific. Having grown up in the NYC area, I found the historical aspects very informative. The plot was complex but engaging. After reading this book by Maan Myeyers, I went on to read the entire series. A very good read and I recommend it.
Negative	"Wrong Poster: The poster I received is okay - it's the one with ""Planet Earth"" written in italics along the bottom, instead of EARTH - but I really would have preferred the one I chose to spend money on, especially since you can buy the one I mistakenly got for .83 instead of $5ish. However, the shipping was fast and the poster was spotless."
Negative	Wrong Poster: They sent a similar but incorrect poster, that is only about half as cool. It was missing the NASA sign in the upper left corner as well as the Earth Solar System lettering. Instead there was the words planet Earth written in Italics and a number of fake stars added to the background. The picture of Earth was the same, but the rest of this poster just doesn't compare to what is shown here.
Positive	RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW: IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.
Positive	Glad I finally found it!: I remember watching this on TV and taped it them. Somewhere along the way I lost the tape and finally found it on here. It is a FANTASTIC show!!! A must have for anyone...no caveats, just anyone who likes music!
Positive	Ricky Martin is the best: Ricky Martin is the best don't ... Ricky has a great voice and his songs are very well written. And he's very handsome too!
Negative	doesn't work if you wear glasses: You look thru a pin-hole to get the sighting, but you can't see thru the pinhole if you wear glasses. If you take your glasses off then you can see thru, but if you're near-sighted like me then you won't be able to see very far in the distance to tell what you're sighting.
Negative	"Huh?: I have never given a movie 1 star before but here it is. ""Woman in the Fifth"" offers very little in the way of plot or relevancy for that matter. The characters are flat, dull, and the dialog is less than inspiring. This movie is about nothing, literally. There is no back story of any characters, no motivation for their actions or lack there of, nothing. Just nothingness. And then it ends thankfully."
Negative	Enigmatic and moody and pointless and poo: Save your money and time. This is nonsense attempting to be arty and important. I'd also forgotten how dire an actor Hawke is. Save your time? There is no explanation or direction. Honey Boo Boo has better writin.
Negative	Not happy. Read the book. Much better.: Very disappointed by this movie. The book was great and so I anticipated the movie would be as well, especially after seeing who was going to star in the movie.Very disappointed. Slow moving movie - lots missing...
Negative	They should have stayed in the fourth.: I was attracted to this movie by the stars. I have not read the book, but I view movies on the basis of a perceived entertainment value. Unfortunately, this one is not very entertaining, nor is it very believable, even as a so-called psychological drama. It's the first time I've ever been disappointed by Kristen Scott Thomas. Save your money.
Negative	Stine: I have been using Exuviance products for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied and feel I have found my skin care products that I intend to use for the future. But, unfortunately I had a bad experience when I ordered the products from Amazon.com(through a dealer called Impossible Discounts)- Rejuvenating Treatment Masque, Hydrating Eye Complex and Clarifying Facial Cleanser. All three products were dirty and did not come with any outer box or sealing. Actually, the products looked used! I have sent this complaint to Exuviance, but have not got any reply and now it is two months since I sent the complaint.. I am afraid that I will not buy Exuviance again nor buying at Amazone again after this incident.
Positive	Cheap backup: There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap
Positive	Handy, or better yet heady flashlight.: If you want your hands to be free, use your head. When I crawl under a desk to connect a computer, now I can see what I am doing and use the glowing screen on my cell phone to make calls and not cast a blue haze on the cables. Works well when I am in the wiring closet (by myself) now I have light were I need it and two hands free.
Positive	Interfaith Symbol Charm: The order came in a timely manner, It was in perfect condition. I was greatly please with the service and the product.
Negative	a minor book on the everest tragedy: lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the book is choppy and doesn't grip you like some other books.if you have all the other everest books go ahead and get it but you'll enjoy 'high exposure by breashears and climb by anatoli b. much better
Negative	"wrong category !: This is not a book about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a book about mt. Everest; this book is about ms. Gammelgaard proving to herself ""she could be the first nordic woman to set foot"" on Chomolungma - big deal ! So maybe you can call this a tale of a driven, achieving lady who singlemindedly pursues a goal, but you will learn nothing about what happened in may, 1996 or about what being on mt. Everest is like; not even close to Krakauer's or Boukreev's books on the same topic: buy those instead."
Negative	"SAVE YOUR MONEY: If you feel you are interested in reading this book I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter. Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a ""Mountain Climber"" would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend ""tip-toes"" each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was ""tip-toeing"" to, with the ""sexy green underware"" she speaks of in her book. Hmm?The book has nothing to do with Mountain Climbing if that is what you are interested in."
Negative	"BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL: As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
Negative	Self-absorbed garbage: Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money.
Negative	"This book is not worth your money. Don't Buy.: This book, like a lot of this summer's ""blockbuster"" movies, enjoyed a major build-up. It did not live up to its hype. It was full of ego and ultimately left me wondering why I bothered to finish it."
Negative	"Just an attempt to cash in on the '96 trajedy.: Everything that needs to be said was said in ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb."""
Negative	"Yawn! Wake me up at the end.: I was excited to come across Lene Gammelgaard's book as I love to read about women who share my taste for adventure. Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has ""been a journalist,"" unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing."
Positive	The most powerful account of Everest I have ever read.: It's about time the world heard a woman's account of the 1996 Everest tragedy. Ms. Gammelgaard delivers the most poignant and moving account to date. Unlike her male counterparts, she is not afraid to delve deeply into her psyche and emotions and shares with the reader her inspiring perspective of Everest and of the greater world we live in.
Positive	Excellent perspective from a member of Scott Fischers' team: A refreshing account of the 96 Mountain Madness Everest expedition from a women who must command respect from the mountaineering world. This book is an inspiration to those who follow their dreams, and go beyond just setting goals in life, regardless of what that may be. A MUST read for anyone who's read Into Thin Air, The Climb, or The Other Side of Everest. I'd recommend catching one of her bookstore appearances as well!
Negative	Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness?: I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it.
Negative	"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,: The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
Negative	A badly written book!: The author came across as a rather selfish and arrogant person, totally self involved. There were enough problems up there on Mt. Everest without Gammelgaard throwing temper tantrums because Scott Fischer wanted her to summit with oxygen. She frequently drew conclusions about other's thoughts and motivations without any basis for these judgements. The writing was boring, choppy, and unedited for grammar. Hopefully, Gammelgaard did get around to paying Mountain Madness the balance of what she owed them. She tried to convince us that she did in fact pay in full. Not true. Frankly, the woman has difficulty in relating the facts with truthfulness. I could never recommend a book this poorly written. She didn't really write about mountain climbing. She wrote more about love of self. Her own self, that is.
Negative	Stick with Krakauer!: What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one.
Negative	"All About Lene: After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"
Negative	"A Major disappointment: Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, ""it's got to get better,"" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to ""get to know her"" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."
Negative	"Boring and shallow!: There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than ""we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm."" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."
Negative	"Self-indulgent drivel: I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the ""inner game"" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."
Positive	Cosmological Eye: I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human.
Positive	We love it- a must have!!: My daughter watches this daily and loves it just as much every time. I enjoy it alot as well. If you have an Elmo fan in your world, this comes with the most recommendations!!!!!!!
Positive	helps children feel less afraid: My daughter who is a huge Elmo fan enjoyed this DVD. She was very sympathetic when Elmo was afraid, but now points out every fire truck, tells me why the firefighters wear their boots, hat and jacket, and can stop, duck and go.
Negative	Too Scary for Younger Tots: While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children.
Positive	"My son's absolute favorite!: We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son's second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home. He would wake up in the morning and beg, ""Elmo Firetruck House?"" He learned all about firefighters and firetrucks. We bought him a firetruck and hat for his birthday and he plays with them while watching this dvd. The firefighters in the video are actual firefighters, and they did a great job of teaching what to do in a fire. We all love this one!"
Positive	"Very Educational!: I have two year old twin girls who are absolutely mesmorized by this film, every day they insist on watching it, and have learned how to handle situations involving a fire without even realizing it. They both claim they want to be fire fighters so they can ""put out the fire in Hooper's Store"". I highly reccomend this movie to any parent wanting to teach their child about fire safety."
Negative	Scared Stiff: My son's day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. He is 2 1/2 years old. He still is concerned most days as we pull in the driveway that they will show it again.
Negative	Not Actually Available: Tried to watch this using our ROKU (we've watched other amazon content this way), but when you try to watch, it says content not available. Annoying since the easiest way to search is online. Back to the search.
Negative	Too boring: My one year old loves 5 of the Sesame Street DVDs we ordered for her. This one however was a total dud. There wasn't much here to keep a kid's interest and the educational value was marginal at best. Look elsewhere.
Negative	Bad job!: I bought this video thinking that it would be a great tool to teach about fires. Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part. They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video. Save your money - this one doesn't do the job.
Negative	Poor quality: The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying. I would look else where for a piano DVD.
Positive	Very good DVD, better than watching Barney reruns over and over.: The video is very good, it is cartoon characters which really kept my 5 year old engaged. I think the information is a little bit complex, but in my case that is a good thing because I dont want him to master the DVD the first time he watches it. I think it is great for what it is, I only wish they had a larger series covering more about the subject. I will have to say the materials on the DVD are very catchy, and my son loves watching it. There is also some song choices at the end. 30 minutes is a bit short, but it seems longer wit the menu of all the songs at the end. There really is nothing else out there like this from what I can see.
Positive	Very Good Western: Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher combine their talents once again to make an exciting western/civil war movie.Scott is ask to leave his Civil War duties back east to run a stageline full time to deliver gold to the union.The transfer from the Warner Archive line is beautiful. Very crisp and colorful.All-in-All gets a B+ from me.
Positive	A good, traditional western: This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc.), but still a very good one (4,5!). Scott is always good. He is so natural that one does not give enough credit for his acting. There are a lot good actors in this film though my favorite Virginia Mayo does not have very much to do. The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great.
Negative	Disappointed: This book basically gives you the history of words and how they were established. It was not what I was looking for! Not a good read!
Negative	Vocabulary Extender: Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Just a poor attempt at a primer.
Positive	Vocab Builder: Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a book of this nature on hand, literally.
Negative	Not up to HD standards: This game is poor - not realistic for anyone that rides a Harley. The game uses keystroke only - no joystick or wheel, and the sound doesn't resemble any Harley I ever heard, including my own. I can't believe HD let Activision use their name for this game.
Positive	"Simple fun stress relief: This is definitely an arcade-type game. It has simple left-right steering controls, accelerate, brake, etc. It is shameless Harley Davidson promotion with H-D road signs showing up every mile or so, and cheesy 80's rock (Poison, I think), but is a LOT OF FUN.You can ride up to your opponents, kick them off their bikes, hit turbo boost to go really fast, and you gain points to buy better bikes and equipment.After playing so many ""simulators"" out there which just succeed in making me more tired after a long work day, this is simple, relaxing fun. Rock on!"
Positive	A Master Teacher!: Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed.
Positive	great cd: Probably ostaras best release to date. Containing elements of neo folk,goth rock,post punk and and numerous other elements..ostara stand apart from most neo folk acts in the vocals..much more poppy and happy sounding. The whole cd has a warm, inviting sound that demand heavy rotation.
Positive	awsome: this was great i got the product earlier then i expected and it was in the exact condition that was stated on amazon. When i go to buy more movies i will deffinitly be going through the same group :D
Positive	PERFECT!!: I absolutely love this series and I am so excited to have it! It's great to be able to watch all your favorite episodes... and even the ones you missed :O . It is a wonderful addition to my collection and I can't wait for future seasons.
Positive	CSI continues to bring the detective side out of you.: After becoming addictive to the CSI series, I just can't seemto get enough. So I purchased the third complete series to geton with the excitement and I couldn't stop.Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotionsand perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And WarrickBrown returns to his oldneighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.All in all, if you're into CSI: Las Vegas, you'll enjoy thisseason as mush as 1 and 2.
Negative	no sale: The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. I think this is kind of strange, considering one of the characters is going deaf.
Negative	"Grainy, CC only with WMP: This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a ""play all"" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I've been able to pop a disk out of."
Negative	worng order: okay so there is no 23 episodes. the seller only gave me a disc with 3 episodes. what a scam? don't buy from this person again.
Negative	"Season Three Lacking: Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons. The episodes are tired and formulaic, and the ""surprise"" season finale is laughable. Continuity is thrown out the window and the storylines are fractured. Buy the first and second seasons to see the best of CSI."
Positive	CSI CONTINUES TO SHINE: Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self. We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more. The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television. Brilliant show just keeps getting better!
Positive	csi: was received faster than expected with package undamaged and in great shape..was so happy it got here in time to give as a christmas gift..will buy from again
Positive	ok: it was good. one of the dvd's glitched after a while of playing. the screen froze and wouldn't play. the dvd's were dirty. i cleaned them up and seemed to work fine. so overall it was ok.
Positive	High Quality CSI: DVD boxed set of CSI season 3, very high quality video for a DVD. Hardly notice the difference when playing back on a HDTV. 5.1 surround sound does not really work well for a TV series, sometimes the dialogs are softer than the background or effects making the story quite hard to understand, especially when there is no subtitles to go along.
Positive	Fun Show..but....: CSI is just one fine TV series, though it can go from engrossing the viewer to grossing the viewer out with some of its all-too-ugly scenarios. Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?
Negative	"Gotta Be There: I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and ""gotta be there"". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again."
Positive	we love it: My 5 year old and I play this game. Its really cute, and theres a ton of stuff to do. 15 different levels and good graphics. my son loves the sound of taz burping an extra big burp but thats about as icky as it gets. All in all a good game.
Positive	Kind of: Taz wanted is a really cool game, because it has a lot of things that have to be done. You can unlock mini games and see many levels. You also get to fight bosses like tweety, sam, daffy duck and a huge elefant. The sound is great because it gives life to the game. The game is filled with secreat passways and catchers who will try to catch Taz. The only bad thing about this game is that the colors are so bright that they could give you a headache and taz MOVES SO MUCH that you could get dizzy. Also at first, the posters will not be so eassy to find and destroy, but you must keep trying.(...)P>Good Luck!!!
Negative	Not so hot: I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right. And if you get motion sick easily...well, Taz pretty much spins a lot. Enough said!
Positive	Enjoyable: Vanessa-Mae is a talented musician. The songs are varied going from classical to popular to standards. It's very enjoyable.
Positive	The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae: While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them.
Negative	"not bad for a cheap knife!: cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
Positive	"Very good, but...: Peter Turchin's ""Quantitative Analysis of Movement"" is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns. Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques. Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared. Turchin is kind enough to provide a special appendix, ""Diffusion for Ecologists,"" for those with relatively weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself). Not easy to understand but well worth the effort."
Negative	Disappointed: I didn't even get a chance to play the game because it instantly crashed my computer; the CD was dirty outside when i got it, I'm very disappointed.
Negative	I must be on something: I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened.
Negative	This is not what I was looking for: Why are they still selling this? Worth a laugh, but the feature is 30 minutes long and I bet your laugh won't last all the way to the end.
Positive	SIMON SAYS: GORE!!!: Just watched this on FearNet and will definitely buy this on dvd! I love crappy, gorey, over the top films and while it breaks no ground it harkens back to the beloved films of the 1980's that throw away plot and logic for gore gags and fun. Crispin Glover is great as Simon and this movie delivers on all levels. Fans of the original Mother's Day, Texas Chainsaw 2 and others of this ilk will enjoy this. I am not saying it is as good them, but good for a chuckle and midnight rewatching. Recommended!
Negative	Why Cripsin? Why?: This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it
Positive	Crazy In the Woods: You must buy this film, It is one of the best horror films that Ive seen in the last couple of years...Stanley & Simon are brothers & well they like to hunt & kill ......
Negative	"stinker: The premise of the movie is nothing new but the acting was horrible. The worst part being Simon's accent. I got so annoyed everytime he would open his mouth and say ""You didn't say Simon says""....The rest of the characters were rather flat...the cheating boyfriend, the best friend cheating with the boyfriend, the stoner and ect. Also, all the flying axes get a little old after the first few times. What I wanted to know was how he could set them all up so quickly...?? The final showdown was odd and cheesey. All things considered it was a very lame and boring movie."
Negative	"Disappointing: I am still new to the horror movie genre, and maybe I'm a noob at this. But, seriously the movie is nowhere near good. Crispin Glover does what he does best, I can recognize his psychotic face from a mile away and still run like hell. But, the story line and the graphics quality was disappointing. The first few minutes watching the movie I thought ""This is not going to go well"" but then I realize the name Blake Lively on the cover and was relieved. ""Thank goodness"" I said, but then I sat through the whole movie only to see Blake enter 5 minutes in the end saying a few lines, looking hot as usual, and capiche. End of movie."
Negative	"Not worth it.: I like Crispin Glover and i am a huge horror and genre fan, but this movie was weak, really weak. I like movies sometimes that are bad, because they are bad in a way that is funny or even enjoyable. This was a movie that was bad and after it was over I say ""I just wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was) of my life on this crap!"""
Negative	truly awful.: crispin glover completely ruins this movie. had a pretty good yet uninspired plot....but still decent enough to stick with...UNTIL about half way through and you seriously cant take him anymore....this movie could of been a ton of fun but ended up truly sucking.
Positive	Brief but Useful Introduction: I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs.
Positive	Don't let it join itself together again!: This is a present for my nephew. I don't see anyeducational value to this game. I used to play thisgame in the arcade. It is a lot of fun. You have tobe quick enough to not let the worm join itself back.Keep you hands on the trigger. Blast away!Enjoy!
Positive	Filled with objective and factual information for Christians: Equip yourself with this handbook of New Age facts, doctrines, comparisons, and rebuttals. This manual will help you educate the precious souls that are being blinded by the dangerous New Age movement. Learn the difference between the Jesus they preach, and the Jesus we know.
Negative	Introduction to New Age Cults: A very brief but necessary introduction for those who don't know but would like to know just a little of what's happing with what is called the New Age Occultism. This well know author of many books in this area introduces the fresh reader to people, topics, and a short glossary, and history to the ever present New Age Occultism, along with the latent dangers of this religious movement.
Negative	The New Age Cult: Save your money, i'm not sure whats more disturbing the fact that a doctor wrote this garbage or that people will probably believe him.
Negative	the item i got is broken: dear sir,i tried to contact you many times ,regarding this itemwhen i opened the box the faucet handle was broke and i can send you pictures if neededregardshaj hasanmohamad.hajhasan@gmail.com
Positive	Good enough for what it claims: The people who have written reviews primarily have gripes that they didn't pass. They must have thought the book was THE ONLY RESOURCE they would need. I used this book and I did pass the exam. It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched. Remember to buy the version that applies to your test year.
Negative	DISAPPOINTED: It is the worst book I have ever seen.I passed both CFA and AICPA and familarize with those materials. I still find it difficult to follow. Not clear explaination, contradiction among arguments and wrong answers for the sample questions.I am very disappointed.
Negative	How not to write a book: I bought this book to write the FRM exam. It is the worst possible written book that I have ever seen. Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment. I wonder if anybody at GARP ever reviewed it before recommending it as a text for the FRM exam.
Negative	The Worst risk management book: It is the worst risk management book I have ever read. Poor organization and explanation, make the matter difficult to be understood. It is a very disappointing book suggested by GARP. I am a CFA charter, I have good knowledge in most of the subjects, I still think difficult in reading this book because of its poor explanation.
Negative	Hope this book is not representative of GARP's credibility: Is there anything less than 1 star? For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?
Negative	Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation?: As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning.
Negative	I Wish I Hadn't: This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials.
Negative	Riddled With Errors: This book is sloppy and riddled with errors. Coverage of topics is uneven. The author delves into some subjects but tap dances around others. You don't need this book for the FRM. I don't recommend it.
Negative	Regret to buy this book: Many reviewers have commend that this book is poor in organization and explanation, I don't want to repeat. But one thing I would like to remind the potential buyers that this book includes all the past exam questions of FRM. I believe that it is the only attractive point of this book.But the explanation of the answers of the past questions are also not very good.
Negative	Lots of errors: This book is misleading. Contains impressive amount of errors, that leads readers to learn wrong concepts. I am starting to doubt that this book was written by a Phd. Or if it was, then lets revoke his title. Hope they release some decent review on this.
Negative	Redundant and Too Expensive: This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff. The message seems to be that, if you can't make sense of his first book, you should shell out $100 to give him a second chance. Save your money. It is not worth it.
Positive	XO PRO CUP WITH SUPPORTER: What can one say about protection for ones family jewels....Not only does the job that is intended but also is relatively comfortable, if that can actually be said about such things. The cup is very hard where it needs to be but as it tapers down ones body it softens up and becomes flexible so you can chase after baseballs without pulling hairs. All in all a great deal for a super price, not expecting to have to be in the market for one again, but would buy this same model again!
Positive	"Stop the Whining! This Album Rules: Just shut your traps for a moment. It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made ""Dimension Hatross"" a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, ""Negatron"" is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace."
Negative	"Voivod sounding like Exodus?: I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
Positive	Recent Purchase: The book I ordered was exactly as described and delivery was even faster than promised.
Positive	Looks great in my Craftsman home.: I still have a few original push button switches in my 1918 house. These wall plates look great. I'm very happy with my purchase.
Negative	"Dopey: The title of this book is extremely misleading.It's packed full of stupid things like ""medicine ball biceps curls,"" ""triceps extensions,"" ""good mornings,"" etc... These are not plyometric exercises! Basically it's an excuse to use a medicine ball for classic weight lifting moves.Combined with this are some very basic throwing moves, of which I was hoping for more of.The drawings are of course crude stick figures, and the directions are weak.I'm returning this book.A little imagination will go a longer ways than this book."
Positive	Best book on plyometric exercises from the best expert.: This is a great book.There are pictures that illustrate everything clearly.Buy this with an Amazon.com medicine ball and you can do a full workout in your home or office.
Positive	Irish traditional folktales with wit, humor and light.: The book is appealing on many levels. It has fantasy,mystery, myth and abundant humor. Most of the tales aremythical in nature. Some are fabricated tall tales.The writing is excellent, with rich detail expressed interse language. A delight from cover to cover.
Negative	"Great book, bad product: The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase ""L"".Find another printing."
Negative	"Great story, no full color prints: I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig ""twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie"".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under ""illustrations"", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the ""River City Press 1978 reprint"""
Negative	don't use this book for a class: The soft back edi- tion of this book is full of misedit- ed copy (full of sep- arated text (annoying isn't it?). It also does not have the publication date or a full title page. I wrote a report using the date of 2006 because that was the only date I could find. Lastly, whole portions of text are missing from this edition. My advice, spend the extra money and get a different edition.
Positive	Concise, comprehensive primer on rose growing: This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days. It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all.
Positive	Tom Bethany bares the bears: Enjoyable read from fun author Jerome Doolittle. Tom takes on the S & L corporates in the most unusual of ways. You _think_ you've read the routine via Crais' Elvis or Parker's Spenser, but you ain't seen nothing til you've met Jerome and a few of his friends. Go ahead, get the book. You won't be sorry.
Positive	Excelent: Is excellent. I recommend it with your eyes closed. The trouble was that my edition came ugly and battered.
Positive	Lovely sensitive and delicate!: This beauty and cute book is the best for catlover!Stunning photos, easy to read colour charts, a lot of informations also regarding the cats...and wonder projects to stitch!I can't wait to stitch all this beauty pussycats!
Positive	Cats of the World in Cross Stitch: I have other books by Jayne Netley Mayhew and Nicki Wheeler and I like every one of them. So far this is my favorite and I like how some of the designs can be used for needlepoint as well as cross stitch. It has designs with jungle cats as well as domestic cats and it is very hard to pick a favorite. Both ladies work very well with each other. I'm looking forward to their new book this month and want to collect all the books they will make in the future.
Positive	Different Covers: I love this book! The cats are beautiful! It works great for needlepoint also. I only gave it a four, because I couldn't do 4.5. My main pet peeve is that the covers get changed on books and if I don't catch it, I end up with duplicates. Luckily I could look inside to compare. My copy is paperback with a ginger cat on the cover... not a tiger, otherwise it would have been a 5.
Positive	THIS JUST MAKES MY HEART: With definite echoes of Yo La Tengo, Illuminations is the record you SHOULD go to sleep to and it's the best to wake up to. Who else writes a song about director Edward D Wood Jnr (Unfair Kind of Fame). This album is the best to come out of Scotland for ages. It also makes one feel depressed without a special someone in their lives. It's best listened to when thinking of loved ones.
Negative	"2 Stars For Persistence: Often I feel some admiration for Stephen Pastel and the way he (and Aggie and Katrina) have stayed true to their course and vision with such dogged persistence. So dogged have they been that, having been reviled for years, they're actually more respected than they've ever been.It was with some regret however that I have to report that any admiration I might have evaporates whenever I actually HEAR The Pastels - to be replaced with a feeling of ""can't they find something better to do after all these years"".Now, don't get me wrong, as Pastels go this CD is a lot better than almost anything they've ever done before - still doesn't detract from the fact that this is music by indier-than-thou smug under-achievers made for a captive audience who are, if anything, even smugger. Some people, it seems, are content to stay in their little ghettoes.The lack of talent is excusable, the lack of ambition is not."
Positive	"Great Christmas classics by a great vocal group.: The Mills Brothers have voices of gold interwoven in a tapestry of magic. Their records made the world sing along, and we still recognize them instantly. Who doesn't know from the first few notes their songs such as ""Paper Doll,"" ""Glow Worm,"" ""Yellow Bird,"" ""You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You"" and many others? On this disc they bring the same level of skill and artistry to Christmas favorites like White Christmas, Silent Night, Joy to the World and more, enriching them with comforting warmth and heartfelt performances. For really nice Christmas music this disc is like a group of old friends sitting by the tree."
Positive	Mill-ing Around, Merrily: I got this album long ago and have never regretted it. It IS my Christmas album (vinyl) that I use throughout the season. The perfect, blended harmonies of the Mills Brothers, the retro arrangements, the classic Christmas tunes, done with such mellow aplomb always amplify my Christmas mood. It oozes class. I would recommend it to anyone wishing a good, Christmas album, but especially to those audiophiles who appreciate the feel for going back a little in time, to our younger years and reminiscing about Christmases past and the good ol' days.
Positive	For Me The Gold Standard: Don't know if it's from me listening to my Dad's albums every Christmas or not? For me this is the Christmas album by which all others are judged.
Negative	Ridiculous!: I sent this unit back to Amazon! Its form factor is contrary to what it says.The camera is small, as they state, but attached to it is a bulky power cable and 9v battery connector. When you hook it all up it's huge! No longer a stealthy camera. Ridiculous!It does not serve its intended purpose.MUVI turned out to be my replacement choice. All reviews are excellent. The image is excellent and it records for hours on an internal battery. There are lots of examples on YouTube.TaosGuy
Negative	wireless Camera: This was a great camera for the two days that it worked. I don't know what happend to it. I came home from work on the second day and my screen was all fuzzy. It just stopped working.
Negative	Junk: This wireless camera only works 5 ft away from the receiver. It is supposed to be 100m. What is the point of wireless if you have to be that close?
Positive	excellent product, but has a short range.: excellent product, but has a very short range of reception and battery life is short lived. You have to adjust the tuner several times before obtaining a good picturem, but not bad for a childs toy as beginner. would recommend to younger kids because it is a fun toy.
Negative	HORRIBLE CAMERA!: I recently ordered this camera hoping I could fly my helicopter controlling it at close range. Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera.
Negative	research before buying: i have bought several of these types of camera's form other sellers that work way better. spend the extra couple buck for something reliable. now saying that, with the cost you can't be picky if you are willing to gamble.SECURITY - DON'T BOTHER ( the tuning is way to sensitive, whereas it it really hard to get a constant clear picture.I would not use it for home security of any type as i live in a townhouse, and when set up it literaly make a cracking sound on the monitor when the unit transmits through one wall. )the range is not 200 feet..... maybe 10 feet line of sight. the advertising is false and i think this is why it was a dissapointing buy. i spent $50 bucks on the same type of unit several years ago and it works through the entire house and outside with no problems. this one has trouble transmitting clearly in the same room if large.Sorry to the seller for the bad review, but people need to know the truth about the item.
Negative	Horrible video: I purchased this wireless camera for use in a medium size model helicopter. Unfortunately the range and quality of the video is quite weak. Even the smallest movement of the camera causes the video to destabilize and lose all detail. Might be good in a fixed location.
Negative	sucks: It's not what you'd expect. Almost all signals around interfere with the video and audio of this camera. I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption. Not a good product at all. Will be more careful what cameras I buy next.
Negative	does not work well: 1) both units require power. the camera does have a 9v adpt but not the receiver. 2) there is always a line of interferance on the monitor cause by noise. Not a good picture.3) Picture quality is not clear, grainy and dis-colored4) 1st range test was only about 50' from base which was located in my bedroom and the camera stopped transmitting in my drive way. I will test it outside later5) ther is no on board memory storage, so you'll have to set up a computer or something.good luck..
Negative	not happy: great concept, however, tuning is imposable, you get some horizontal instability 98% of the time. but when you get it, it looks decent!
Positive	TYKES: My child is 4yrs old and is REALLY into video games. With pure triumph to win a game. Alot of games are not made for the youngins. He is able mess with this game longer than five or more minutes. I as an adult don't enjoy it but he gets hours of pleasure.
Negative	Please don't waste your money: I bought this for my 3 year old and it is the dumbest game ever. It has really bad graphics, game play is mega slow, and the music is horrid. They should be ashamed of themselves. Please save your money and buy something else.
Positive	Best Cover Album Ever!!: This is a great album with many catchy tunes. Listenable from start to finish and a great primer into SCOTS.
Positive	"Wow, Great CD!: I've been a SCOTS fan a long time. I've seen them many times live, and have purchased most of their music. I get a little frustrated with their ""White Trailer-Trash"" persona because I think it detracts from the fact that their a great rock and roll band. Rick's surf'n swamp guitar work just gets better along with the rest of the band.Thats why I dig this new album so much. I seems like the band really put some time and effort into this disc. Hearing them play The Kinks 'Muswell Hillbilly' and making it their own is a beautiful thing. Rick Miller tearing into 'Tombstone Shadow', awesome. Makes me wish they would do a whole album of Creedence covers! The whole band is really on the same wave-length playing each one of these diverse tunes. Its a shame that 'Walk Like a Camel' was their biggest hit. They deserve a much wider audience. Great Disc."
Positive	"Gloriously Tacky!: REVENGE OF THE SON OF THE WORLD'S TACKIEST POSTCARDS is indeed tacky. I had no idea that the world was peppered with postcards such as these. In here you'll see hilarious cards from the 50's and 60's and find yourself asking, ""why would someone send a postcard about chopped Balkan horse hearts?"" Just be glad someone did, otherwise your everyday boring life would be deprived of such campy, pointless humor. This is a book you'll pick up periodically for years and laugh ferociously every time. I promise. A BONUS: The postcards are perforated and ready to send! Certainly a must!"
Negative	A VERY VERY VERY SORRY GAME: this game will never earn akklaim ne sort of money except for ppl who like these kind of lame games it really isnt gwd really the cameara angles really bad too the grphix ok but who care bout grphix when u cant even get a good view of ur character nd the surroundings u will get bored of this game fast dont buy dun ever rent it im serious this game is so confusing too when u collect hearts it doesnt even tell u information on how to get the heart except a wierd riddle they give you that doesnt make any sort of sense plus once u manage to get a heart u get too strart over isnt dat fun u loose all ur extra life u earned and all the heart pieces u earned u need 100 to get a heart wow say u got 99 heart pieces then u pik up a heart guess what u get to start all over collecting the heart pieces dont even rent this game this game is so sorry i bought it and it took me forever to trade with my friend for one of his game i had to give him 5 games for 2 games
Negative	Camera controls make life miserable: I like platformers, which is why I got this game. I've played it off and on for a week now, only because I hate not finishing something I start. If it weren't for that fact, I'd never touch this game again. The graphics are good, but the camera controls are [bad]. I've died more than once because the game decided to adjust the camera angle while I was in the middle of crossing some tiny bridge or climbing a narrow ledge.
Negative	oh well: Well yea sure its supposed to be this wonderfull, amazing, groundbreaking platform game. Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank. All in all it probably would be pretty fun and thus you should add one or two stars if your new to this kind of thing, or add a few stars if you really really really like large environments or just platforming in general.
Negative	Vexx fails: Basically, you can say that this game is about 30% fun and 70% Frustrating. The gameplay is uneccesarily difficult at times and ceases to be 'fun' after about 4 levels in. The camera is terrible. Some have said here dismiss it as 'oh well, all platform games have camera problems'. However, this game definately has the lamest camera of them all.Another dissapointment is the fact that there are no milestones. If you [expire], you get to start over. Period. No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time. Isn't that Fun?Acclaim has definately failed in their foray into platform gaming. Get Ratchet and Clank or Rayman, you will actually enjoy those games. This one looked like it had potential but is just too frustrating. Don't waste your money on this game. It just ain't worth it.
Positive	VEXX: This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide. It's very basic, dosen't cover the controls, and just skims over the walk throughs. It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline.
Positive	HE LOVED BIG BROTHER: Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once.
Negative	Poor quality on Kindle: I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup.
Positive	1984 is Still A Possibility: I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother.
Positive	A must read: This is one of the few books I think everyone should read at one point or another of their life. I read this book about 7 years back and I think it does an amazing job of narrating the harrowing experience of people under an oppressive regime.
Positive	A Frighteningly Real Masterpiece: This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic.
Positive	My Favorite Book: I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact.
Positive	"Big Brother is watching you...: Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is ""correcting"" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary. He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."
Positive	"This is a Very Good Book Indeed.: This is one of the best written books I have had the opportunity to read. Those of you who gave it a 1 are ignorant. And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the ""Homeland Security"" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world. (Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"
Positive	Parallels: 1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending.
Positive	A good book that gets old fast: 1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends.
Negative	"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I: While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
Negative	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: 1984 by George Orwell, is the most BORING book I ever read for school. To me the plot was not interesting, the characters were useless and the time period .... Although the idea of the government controling everything is scary and most likely true it just didn't have any emotions to make it good. For a book to be good it needs to have emotions, and this book lacked them, and there was also no dialouge which to me is important.KNOT
Negative	BORRRIIIIING!: I read this book in 8th grade. It was fairly easy to read and was not too hard, but it was by far the most boring and pointless piece of literature that I have ever read in my 15 years of life. I MUCH would have rather read a Case Note!If you are considering purchasing this book, I thouroughly discourage it. If you MUST read something by George Orwell, read Animal Farm. It is a pretty good book...
Negative	"""classic"" does NOT mean good!!!: If you havent been forced to read this book while in school, or hadnt had a chance to grab it at the library, run while you can. 1984 might have been scary 100 years ago, but not now. If you like reading about old people think they are beating the system by saving a PAPERWEIGHT, then by all means...The book has multiple plot holes as well. Beware the ""government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people"" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"
Negative	Centennial Edition a Rip Off!! Buy a cheaper version: I had never read 1984 and was very excited to do so only to regret purchasing this edition. In the forward (by thomas pynchon) the entire ending is revealed in great detail. I knew what to expect through the entire book and I really wish that I could get my money back. Dont buy the centennial edition, or at least dont read the forward if you want a nice surprising read.
Positive	1984 review: The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale.
Positive	1984... ahead of its time: I just finished- literally- reading the book 1984 by George Orwell and my very first thought as I gazed over the last four sentences upon my nook version of the book was anger. Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended
Positive	Ugh. Gives me the shivvers.: This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars.
Positive	Great book. Ready many times over.: I wish I could just rate the book w/out writing a review! I'm not an author. I don't have a way with words!
Positive	Distrubing Portent of Socialism's Logical Ends: This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end.
Positive	Important for its portrayal of the mechanisms and motivations of totalitarian power: Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power. A dramatic, illuminating read.
Negative	"George, Stick to Non-Fiction: This is the second time I've been forced to read this book for aclass, and I have to ask, ""What's the point?"" Maybe if you live in a country that's a monarchy, this book's worth reading, but this is *America*, ok? The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. ""Brave New World"" played up the science fiction aspect of it's ""futuristic"" setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (""Animal Farm""), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (""double-speak?"" Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try ""The Road to Wigan Pier,"" which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened. It's 2000. 1984 was a bad movie with Michael J. Fox."
Negative	"Only read this if you like getting depressed.: This is a good example of the fact that pessimistic and shocking books often receive rave criticism while dynamically optimistic books are dubbed ""unrealistic""... NO further comment."
Negative	"A redundant book of philosophy and vericose vains: While embarking on this ""classic,"" don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"
Negative	"The Political Paranoids' ""Gospel of Orwell"": Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's ""Newspeak"" should include these additions: ""Propaganda is Truth""; ""Truth is Absolute""; ""Freedom springs from Fear""; ""Extremism is Virtue."" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as ""The Crying of Lot 49."" At least IT has the virtue of being well written."
Negative	not good: Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it.
Negative	poor: This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics. It is crude, heavy-handed, superficial propaganda.
Negative	A little too slow: I found 1984 to be an intriguing book. The plot of the book was interesting. How the author went about telling the story was too slow for me. I found it hard to pay attention while reading it. Throughout the entire book there were bits of intereseting parts followed by several paragraphs of, what i found to be, random information. I though it was a great plot but the storyline wasn't to my liking.
Positive	A old classic that is still pertinent now: This is the second time I have read this book. The first was for school. I enjoyed it more this time because of the things I did appreciate the first time.
Positive	1984: Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described.
Positive	A Modern Classic: 1984 is a great read but not a compelling one. It can be a little hard going at times. The characters are a little frustrating thus making it a little annoying to read. Still it is a great classic and well worth persuing to the end.
Negative	Big Brother Lives: Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online.
Negative	thing plot, boring read: Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it.
Positive	Very powerful!: There are few books that I reference as much as this one. Almost every aspect of the homogenization of culture and individualism is realized in this book. You can not discuss world politics without reading this book. Just read the darn book!
Positive	Better than most: The author has come very close to predicting the future, but we still have a long way to go.A very interesting story built around the future. Although 1984 has come and gone, the future of cameras watching our every move is very possible.As the war in Kosovo proved, some tactics are not just fiction.
Positive	"Timeless: I recall the flurry of TV and print documentaries that appeared in 1984, all striving to answer the question ""How close are we?"" I thought that generally they missed the point.Yes, Orwell's classic was ostensibly about Totalitarianism, but on a deeper level, it is all about control. 'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled. And, to this day, it still sounds a prescient warning."
Positive	One of my favortie novels ever!: This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five...
Negative	It was a very good description of life during anti-social ti: It was a very good description of life during anti-social time
Negative	"DON'T READ THIS BOOK: i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a ""classic"" but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."
Negative	this is the worst book i have ever read!!!!*-: 1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book.
Positive	2 MORE ORWELL PROPHECIES CAME TRUE IN 2008: His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?
Positive	True Prediction: On of the best and prophetic novels ever written about the descent into dehumanizing socialism.
Positive	great book, but not much action: This book does a great job describing the society and people in it, but if you're reading it for the great action scenes, you might want to look elsewhere. This book is considered a classic for a reason. It actually makes the reader think and contemplate the future of our society compared to the one in the book. So if you're in the mood for a good sc-fi read, I would suggest reading this.
Positive	very critical but this is the best book ive ever read: people are complaing about the plot but i found this book extremely entertaining and i cannot look at the world or listen to the news the same way. Read the dictionary of newspeak terms at the end and you wont be as depressed when you are done (still not a happy ending but atleast big brother falls)
Positive	"More Relavent Now than Ever: Anyone who is interested in the nature of power and manipulation of the masses should read this book. Despite the fact that it was orriginaly an inditement against Stalinism, it is still relevant in 21st century America.The nature of the ""War on Terror"" could have been taken dirrectly from the book, in places word for word. The story provides facinating insight into the way that reasonably inteligent people can chose to behave in irrational ways in the name of partiatism and loyalty."
Positive	"Everyone Must Read This: My brother isn't a person who reads so when he proudly told me he finished 1984, and that I MUST read it, I decided to try it.I was caught up in this book very quickly and I found myself reading it at work. I couldn't put it down. The story is frightening, especially when you think about some of our current issues such as ""Homeland Security"", and the new measures the government is taking to ""protect"" us. Given the current situation in this country I think it is essential to read 1984. This book has made me rethink somethings."
Positive	"Dark and Bold: 1984 is written in the style of the ""negative utopia."" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."
Positive	Read it!: Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book. It may show you how human you really are...
Positive	Really Good Book: 1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more.
Positive	The Greatest Love Story of Our Time.: 1984 is a social commentary on history and the appalling state of public policy and society generally told through a love story that resonates with a deep familiarity for all modern readers.
Positive	"A work of genius that provides warning: 1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the ""future"" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."
Positive	so far so good...: i'm reading this book in my english class right now and i'm actually not even done... i'll admit in the beginning it was pretty slow and kind of boring but we're almost done with it now and i really like it.. i'm not too into reading or anything and it's pretty hard for me to find a book i like... i guess what i'm saying is that it's a good book and people should read it :)
Positive	scariest forshadow: a personification of the human spirit. after reading of the living death portrayed by the author, i realized that the man sentenced to life enprisonment has liberties unbound. to conceive the perils of this novel, is to enjoy life.
Positive	More thrilling than any Steven King book!!: People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think
Positive	Great Classic Everyone Should Read: Orwell's classic about Big Brother that will really keep you thinking. I read in High School and then again recently. Although 1984 is long past, the ideas put forth in this book shadow a darker image of what America could become that will make you think.Great classic! Go read it.
Positive	"History repeats itself: George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the ""true"" narrative begins."
Positive	"Not just a ""Political"" Novel: As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
Positive	Prophetic and Frightening: Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate.
Positive	Still a very good story: 1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable.
Positive	"1984 - Frighteningly Realistic: George Orwell's horrific representation of Oceania, a world power and dominating force throughout the story, is a frighteningly realistic presentation of how governments work. Orwell displays the common theme of disinformation (called ""doublethink"")used by government powers. Although 1984 has come and passed, the idea that governments can gain totalitarian control through complacent, uniterested citizens is not far from present conditions. 1984 is an excellent read, filled with wondrous insight for everyone."
Positive	"Good Read as Both Sci-Fi and Analysis of Society: This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's ""Prince"" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious ""Book"" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."
Positive	Instant paranoia!: 1984 is a classic and rightfully so! It does not matter that the year has come and passed without such a world but there are subtelties that resemble such a world. In the wake of recent events the atmosphere (in the U.S.) is begining to strikingly resemble some of the aspects of Orwell's nightmarish world.
Positive	Depressing, but enlightening.: As an American, I enjoy freedoms that are alien to the majority of the world. If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read. Every person who reads this book gets something different out of it, but I can guarentee if you read with interest you will get something out of it.
Positive	"Ain't the future scary?: THe Party dominate all aspects of life and Big Brother is everywhere with cameras and microphones. Winston Smith is the central character whose diary gives him away along with his affair with Julia. Both are brainwashed into thinking The Party is always right, despite evidence to the contary and Winston ends up staing his love for Big Brother- the ""victory over himself"". O'Brien is Winston's nemesis in breaking him down and is a most interesting characther. ..."
Positive	Time to think: George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius.
Positive	Fantastic: Never has a book made me think so much and yet be absolutely terrified for the future. Ending is very bleak and gives one the impression that all hope is lost, but I still highly recommend it.
Positive	One of 20th Century's Greatest: This book contains supreme beauty and the worst ugliness. One of the greatest works of the 20th century, one all should have a go at.
Positive	"2008 is 1984: ""It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words"" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."
Positive	Great book: If you're politically inclined, you'll love this novel about Oceania. Though this book is fiction, you'll find more similarities with your life than you thought possible. The symbolism is great and should be a must-read for any high school student in a high school civics course.
Positive	The dark world of the future: After reading 1984 it is easy to see why it is a classic. George Orwell's predictions are a dark and terrifying world that captures the reader and forces them on. The stories told is one that may yet come to pass. The things he predicts have in some cases already been implemented in some areas of the world. I found the book to be a somewhat difficult read, so don't expect to breeze through it. All in all I rate it a 5 out of 5.
Positive	"Go to the real source: This is a great book. Because it has been unsuccessfully re-written many times by lesser minds people suggest this as the source. However, the book ""We"" by Eugene Zamatin, an exiled Russian (like Nabokov, or Dostoyevsky), came first is even more powerful. I believe that it is out of print (at least the english translation), but if there is enough interest in it that could be rectified. Also, now more than ever the theme of governmental control is very relevant."
Positive	1984 - Fascinating and Terrifying (Doublethink at work!): This book is a work of genius. It is so much more than science fiction. In fact, it's bleak vision of the world is scary because of its plausibility. It is so completely credible and convincing. It is brilliant philosophy, masterful thriller, and love story all at the same time.There is enough explanation about the plot of the book in other reviews, so I'll spare you. This book captured me completely. Read this book if you like thought provoking literature.
Positive	"Amazing: Orwell was a pioneer in this form of literature. His insight into a ""possible"" future held more accuracy than I'm sure even he imagined.The book is a struggle of man vs. ministry. How far will the few in positions of power go to improve their personal ideals in the guise of overall social improvement?I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dark themes. The ending had me in tears."
Positive	if it was a prediction...: If this book represents Orwell's circa 1948 prediction of 1984, he wasn't exactly right, but he wasn't completely wrong either. Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health.
Positive	"a classic: This is a timeless book that seems more true with each passing year. Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no ""memory hole"" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny."
Positive	NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR: A very well written piece of literature for its time. In light of the current state of affairs, it is rather frightening. It was a good read in High School and an even better fread today.
Positive	Some classics are over-rated. This is not one of them.: Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother.
Positive	"Nineteen Ninety Nine: This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's ""A Clockwork Orange"", which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"
Positive	allthough it shows the extreme, it shows a possilbe truth: This book describes an extreme situation of what totalitarianism can lead to. But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it
Positive	"Great Book, Couldn't Put It Down!!!: Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading ""the book"" is rather boring and takes a while to read. Overall I would suggest reading it as soon as you can."
Positive	Wow: My class could do this for an extra credit grad and I am glad about that. This book is frightening realistic. The technology in this is possibly and some of its here, the government has come and gone in a lesser degree, and the issues faced are here. If someone with enough brains and had a hated enemy of the people, this government may come. The story is very believable and is a must read for casual and serious readers alike.
Positive	"Doubleplusgood!: Wow! I read this after reading ""Animal Farm"" and found it fascinating. It's amazing that a book written so long ago could so vividly portray an author's prediction of how the world would be in 1984. Slightly scary, when you think of how Communism did take control of an empire. George Orwell's ""1984"" is a classic that should always be remembered."
Positive	"Still poignant after 64 years...Newspeak, Big Brother, and Orwell: This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the ""truth"" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."
Negative	Kindle Edition is a very sloppy copy/paste: The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file.
Positive	"Thank our lucky stars government isn't like that...yet.: Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things. Readers ask themselves ""WHY? Why do these people let themselves be subjected to such mind control?"" Really it's all the people know. Somehow to them it makes perfect sense that the past doesn't exist. Scary. One of the best books I've ever read"
Positive	A masterpiece!: I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece.
Positive	The best book you should read, but don't in High School: Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come.
Positive	This book is great, but terrifying.: After I read this book, I was so disturbed that I couldn't concentrate on my homework. Since I could do nothing else, I thought about the book. I realized how lucky we are that we live in a society with privacy, fairness, and freedom. I though it was inhuman when the man in jail (I'm not saying who) was proud of his daughter for turning him in after hearing him mutter in his sleep against the Party. This is the least of the inhuman things that happen. I really am able to apreciate our living in a free society. I hope others can too.
Positive	An Ordaniary man and his response during a Revolution: This was a wonderful book where the main character, Winston Smith is compelled to speak out aganist Big Brother and the end result is exactly what any one of us would have done. A lot of people I know hated the ending, but I think the ending makes the book. It shows the way that we as humans really do respond in situations like that. Absolutley incredible. This is one of the best books I have ever read.
Positive	Mrs. man Vanen's Review of Nineteen Eighty-Four: After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution. I read this book on the Supreme 747 PowerJet on my way to Australia. Despite being disturbed several times by male-stewardesses, I was able to tell that this was a fantastic book. It is unfortunate that this book caused the writer years of sickness and was bedridden for the remainder of his life. And that I was not included in his will. read this book!Judas man Vanen
Positive	Sheer Brilliance!!!!!!!: Orwell's 1984 is certainly one of the greatest novels ever written. It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement.
Positive	I liked this book.: This was a good book. I just finished reading it for a tenth grade English class and it was good. It was kinda boring at first, but I liked it. I would recommend it to my friends.
Positive	This Book gives you Insight of Human Mind: This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture.
Positive	I love this book!: Twisted view of a future world, even more creepy looking at it from a time 20 years after this imaginary future... it is interesting to compare and contrast this book with reality...
Positive	"My ""1984"" Review: I think that the book ""1984"", written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions. It was a book about a man fighting for his rights only to fine out he had to give in a bit. ""1984"" was a book that captured me into its story and I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"
Negative	"Slow, Boring, and Depressing: I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading ""The Partner"", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."
Negative	review for 1984: I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.
Negative	An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense: I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it.
Negative	The Most Boring Book I Ever Read: I think 1984 is not very interesting. The words are difficult. I had no clue what was really going on. It would be less boring if it was shorter and broken down so it would be easier to understand. You might like this book if you are interested in predicting the future and you can read lots of difficult words and know what they mean. Keep your dictionary close!
Positive	great purchase: great book, great presentation, first time i bought something for kindle. really please so far. looking forward to new titles and new features for kindle.
Positive	Read this book!: I really can't give this novel any less than five stars. I read it every year and find something new, something often horrifyingly accurate in whatever political climate you're in. READ IT!
Positive	A classic: Chilling especially given how powerful the media has become in our current society. Orwell was brilliant, and in this book, he is able to identify the critical elements of a democratic society that we often just take for granted.
Negative	This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn: This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn..the condition is definitely NOT GOOD..Got this book for $4...It's not worth more than 25 cents for sure.
Negative	"A Good Book but Not the Best!!: This book is essentially the same as ""The Brave New World"" but expressed in a totally different way. Somehow, I like the ""The Brave New World"" better. It gave me a totally different view."
Negative	Review of this digital download, not of the material, merely the presentation and the first version downloaded but removed.: Ok, just where to begin. First this digital download version is a joke. Someone did not format correctly. Each line is either double or triple spaced, even if you change font. Why stop there? Why not put a word per page?I would like to return the digital download, but can not find a phone number to speak with someone. Or a mechanism to return it.1984 is a good read. Content is good, presentation, not so much.
Positive	Genious, Peo-ple!: have you read? Its the book everyone is reading now. It shows what its like to live in a totalagrarian society like Nazi Germany or W. U.S.
Positive	"I read this book 10 years ago...: I read this book back in high school, thinking ""Well, it's a classic. One of those books I SHOULD read."" I was right. There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read. There's constant references to this in media, pop culture, etc. It's just an important piece of literature. I think every single person who cares about their own intelligence should read this book. You just HAVE TO! Nuff said."
Negative	"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
Negative	"monotony: Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
Negative	"CONFUSING!!!: I READ THE BOOK ""1984"" BY GEORGE ORWELL. tHE BOOK WAS ABOUT A GUY NAMED WINSTON WHO FOUND A DIARY AND WROTE HIS FEELING IN IT WHICH WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS RATHER BORING AND CONFUSING TO READ. I DIDNT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE THINGS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHEN READING THE BOOK I SUGGEST THAT YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY AND WONT BE CONFUSED."
Negative	George Go Home: George had a good idea, I'll give him that, otherwise the book fell short. Very short. For me the book took a downword turn during the time where Winston started having a love affair with some girl. This girl latter became a thought police inforcer, which surprised me none. I found the book to be a bore of a read and very predictable. My advise to all of you fair readers is to steer clear of this vile book. You will live longer because of it.
Negative	I think this book is horrible: I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life. For the people who read and enjoyed this book...GET A LIFE!
Negative	Big Brother is Watching!: George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great.
Negative	"Garbage and other phrases...: Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."
Positive	Timeless and Enduring Social Commentary: Orwell's tale of a society where not only behaviour, but also thought is controlled, seems to grow ever more relevant as the years pass and new technologies of surveillance emerge. 1984's concept of `Big Brother' has passed into everyday use, and the `telescreens' used not just to broadcast, but to watch people, increasingly appear throughout the real-world society in the form of surveillance cameras. Whilst the totalitarian governments of `Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War. A timeless and enduring tale that will remain relevant and controversial well into the future, despite being set in the past.
Positive	1984: This is yet another book that is difficult to put down. There are a few sections that you have to trudge through but it is entirely worth it. This is a very thought provoking novel and is beautifully written.
Positive	Must Read: 1984 has come and left, some may say that this book has lost its importance after the collapse of communism. I think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate. The important point about 1984 is that if you don't pay attention 1984 can always become a reality. Need to listen to some of the people running for the top spot in this country and you can see them building their own ministry of truth.R HemingwayPast Twilight
Positive	Hackneyed but prophetic: The power of Orwell's writing comes from the ideas expressed therein, not from the characterization or the quality of the writing. Orwell's characters in this novel are crafted of the finest cardboard, the writing is crafted of the finest of didactic lead, but the ideas therein are important -- because they are prophetic of what 2004 could be, and what 2003 may be becoming, if the current leadership of our country has its way.
Positive	"Required Reading for every intelectual and all others!: Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..""a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.""This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."
Positive	"Thought-provoking: If you have not read this, I strongly recommend it ... ESPECIALLY if you are like me, and somehow ""escaped"" having this assigned to you either in high school or in college, but have always wondered what the hype was all about.Too many times today, you will hear this book discarded as a bunch of prophesies that were way off -- e.g., that in the year 1984 there would be computers and ""telescreens"" that would all but read our minds; that ""Big Brother"" would always be watching us. Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of ""Big Brother"" -- i.e., how information is ""cleansed"" to ""protect"" us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"
Positive	21st century reading: It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world.
Positive	Big Brother is watching you!!!: 1984 is about a man named Winston Smith and the totalitarian society he lives in. Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today.
Positive	Where the dystopia begins: I'm a first time reader of 1984 and am in love. I can't believe that it didn't show up in my reading list before now! I have been a long time fan of dystopia and am so excited to have read finally a founding book of the genre.I was absolutely enthralled. It has been a while since a book has grabbed me like this. To say I'd recommend this book is a gross understatement. If you've been holding off on reading this stop holding off!!
Positive	Great book, skip intro, expensive ebook: Loved the book. But if you read it, skip the intro! It is extremely spoiling for the plot, it annoys me that it wasn't put at the end. After reading a couple of spoilers I skipped it. Similarly, it annoys me that the ebook is the most expensive option.Other than that I find this an epic book, a must read.
Positive	Be Aware! This is where our government is headed: It is a world very much like ours today - no privacy, ignorance of the world and wars around us, everyone conforming to be no different than ones neighbor, and government only telling the public what they want them to know.Open your eyes and read this warning to what very well could become true if we do not change.
Positive	Big Brother in the back door!: Well here we are in 2000, the year 1984 just a memory. Our fears of Orwell's book being a prophecy fully abated.Like most people I first read this book in school. Like most people I came away with the idea that the collectors of information will end up like Big Brother. I too cried '1984' when the government tried to collect even more info on us.Shortly after Princess Diana's death, though, I read this book for a second time. I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information. Who controls information today? The media. Compare Princess Diana's life to Winston's.Very good book. Well worth reading again as an informed adult. At least that is this proles opinion.
Positive	"Required reading in these fictitious times: No novel seems to be more relevant these days than George Orwell's 1984. While the year has passed the ideas of trickery and deception by the government still exist. Oceania could easily be the United States and Big Brother could be any one of the three letter orginizations in the US. No there arent telescreens everywhere, but thanks to the deceptivly titled ""Patriot Act"" Orwells nightmare is eerily closer to reality than ever before. Read this book. Period."
Positive	1984: 1984 by George Orwell is a story of a totalitarian government and a man living under its power. Winston, the main character, struggles to fight the ruling outer party, even though his works for them changing historical documents to fit the parties needs. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys conspiracy stories. The only negative thing I can say about this book is it becomes slow in some parts, but over all it is a great read.
Positive	A frightening tale of an enslaved, socialist future: 1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life. There's little more I can say. Just read the book for yourself; it's what I call required reading.
Positive	"Oh, god, please...: Dear ""reader from Mt. Pleasant, MI"":What on earth are you talking about? You think Orwell actually wrote 1984 because he was mad at the world? Christ, you make it sound like 1984 is the work of a nihilist. 1984 is a dark satire of totalitarian governments. No, the Soviet Union was not as bad as Oceania, but a satire is supposed to exaggerate.The novel has a perfectly legitimate political purpose, and has nothing to do with Orwell being mad at the rest of the world. You clearly didn't understand much about the book at all.As for why I liked it, most of it has been said already. It offers great insight into human nature and politics. Plus it's very well written. It is also probably the most immediately interesting and intriguing books I've read."
Positive	"Chilling tale of anti-utopian England: I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve ""the Party"" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."
Positive	Fine book to read: Even if some people disagree with me, I will say this is one of the best books you can read. Everyone must read this book, it has the power to change your beliefs about the world.1984 goes deep to show you what the world COULD be like if a ruling party did all the right things to gain complete control over the populace. Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading.
Positive	Not just cheap propaganda!: I've read the book and found not only fun in it, but also deepness and complex political explanations. It is not only propaganda against communism, cause as everybody knows Orwell, in fact, liked communism ideals. It shows how individualism is smashed in a totalitarian society. I also recomend the animation movie AntZ. As many have seen it is not meant for kids...
Positive	"Perfect.: Just three words; scary, depressing and wonderful. Definetely the best fiction about the future that i've read . Even better than Huxley's 'Brave new world'. I now start to feel afraid about the future. I now start to wonder if there are big brothers, ""ministry of peace""s , shortly ""OCEANIA""s waiting for us in the future?War can never be peace. Whatever type of future it is.1984 is the best novel I've ever read."
Positive	doubleplusgood: it moved me to tears and no book has ever done that, it was very deep. very scary because its pluasable
Positive	Delicious, quenched all my political hunger!!!: Well I read this book in the following reasons. TO learn about more in socialism and communisms differences and to learn a different point of view. I guess this book applies to every different reader something different because it holds many values and the values can be undestood from many ways. In simple quotes many things were hidden to find out them was like a puzzle for every reader I guess. I thing this was a book that I really liked to read and also I would like to share my ideas with other readers of this book and other readers of books related to this topic.
Positive	A book that deserves thought: When I try to think of my reaction to this book, it goes beyond enthusiam. In fact, at first, I was speachless after reading the last sentence; the build-up was so intense that I actually thought that I was reading a historical account of the human experience. For those of you who haven't read the afterword by Erich Fromm, I highly recommend you do. He provides a much needed explanation for Orwell. This book offers a very important vision, one that needs due evaluation. If you read this account of the future, you must read Huxley's Brave New World, as he offers an alternative.
Positive	excellent, well written and ver realistic: i thought it described well the possibilties of the power of the govbernment if we the people do notstnad up against the oppression the are providing.
Positive	Fascinating, but...: I'm glad I read this book. It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue. Good or bad, that's the way it is.Otherwise, this lived up to hype and icon status that it is known for.
Positive	You wanna be suicidal?: Orwell tells a story about Winston Smith, a man living in the utopian world of 1984! The book deals with his struggles, and eventually, the story's end is so depressing that in the end, you may want to commit suicide or take up liquor. BEWARE
Negative	"Depressing: Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950""s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. ""Cold Sassy Tree"" comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."
Positive	"A Grim Orwell: This is such a grim, frightening and scary book by George Orwell. Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for ""thought crimes."" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, ""I love you"" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim. However, still a good book.*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
Positive	Right in the feels: George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments.
Positive	The classic privacy horror story: Nineteen Eighty-Four remains the popular watchword for invasion of privacy fifty years after its publication. The novel can be read as a warning against the malign personalization that could be possible with a systematic technological attack on privacy. `The worst thing in the world,' says the hero's torturer, `varies from individual to individual.' The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. ``The command of the old despotisms was ``thou shalt not''. The command of the totalitarianisms was ``Thou shalt''. Our command is: ``*Thou art*.''
Positive	A mind altering book.: This has to one of the best books i have ever read. It shows us what the world would be like if governments obtained complete power over the populace. It makes one think, and if you are not ready for how it makes you think then you may find it long and boring. Give it a chance though, you'll be rewarded.
Positive	Big Brother is Watching Yo' Ass: WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. I am unable to adequately describe to you here how utterly amazing (also horrifying, nightmarish, grim, cold, and bleak) this book is. If you feel that you're capable of transcending to a new level of intellectual awareness and intelligence, then you're ready for this book. People who read this book that aren't ready for this transition will find the experience unfulfilling.
Positive	A very critical view of a very possible future: Everyone knows the story of Big Brother sybolizing the communist movement in the USSR in the 1940's, but this book is far more than that. Towards the end of the book, where other people has refeered to as boring, there is a very deep section on the human mind and our understanding of the things happening around us. This is clearly one of the greatest pieces of lititure ever written.
Positive	"Timeless Future Fiction: As gripping and wrenching now as it was on my first reading in 1972. For old film buffs there is a black and white production with Richard Burton and Fred Hurt. Also excellent. A modern dystopian tale available on Amazon, ""Transfer"", by Jerry Furland, portrays a new tyranny not unlike Orwell's in it's ubiquity. ""Transfer"" is stunninglyfrsh and topical. Like Orwell, Furland's impact is a mirror of the reader, hated or loved, but never hohum. Check it out. But hit Animal Farm before you leave Orwell:)"
Positive	Thought-provoking and at times chilling: Many have heard allusions to Big Brother through television or movies. Many have heard that they should read this book because it's a classic, or because of the amazing predictions from 1949 about life in the future. Everyone should read this book.If you read it hoping to find action, or hoping to find a tie to the world as we know it, you most likely won't comprehend the actual meaning of the words. You'll be most successful if you consider what we have today compared to what we had when Orwell wrote the book in 1949. Think of how much the world has changed, and how far there is left to go.Read this book, and every chapter think of the relationship to everyday life. This isn't a book that should be skimmed. Think of the implications of Orwell's predictions. Realize that it could happen.Is it a novel, or is it possible? Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?
Positive	Frighteningly close to the truth: For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984.
Positive	Is this Bush and Ahmadinejad's playbook?: I never read Orwell in school for some reason and I am glad I waited. I can't believe this was written in the late 40's. O'Brien's descriptions of seeking power for power's sake and the mutability of truth and history have never been more applicable to current events. Reading this book now, you really start to feel like this must be on Karl Rove's desk.
Positive	"This book will make you think: Perhaps the description will seem turgid and tiresome as you read 1984, but in retrospect it will have been to your great advantage to have read of this negative utopia. Regarding the one reviewer who gave this book one star -- please, actually pay attention before you write another review, and get your facts straight. Julia wasn't in the Thought Police. Why don't you go back to English class, and after you've mastered ""Green Eggs & Ham"" try Orwell again. Thank you."
Positive	Both excellent and important: Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written.
Positive	"Orwells dark but good book: George Orwell's, ""1984"", is a classic and detailed adventure that will leave you asking for more. The story is set in London where Winston, the main character, works for big brother. But he soon finds himself questioning Big Brother and how he works.For a while Winston tried to blend in with the crowd and not really stand out. But when Winston starts to remember his childhood, he begins to question Big Brother. Winston soon finds himself wondering what life was like before big brother. But unless he takes a real chance, he has no way of changing anything.One flaw I found with the book was its detail. I like a lot of detail, but this book overdid it. I would soon found myself thinking about other things and not the book."
Negative	"1984: 1984,by Georgee Orwell,is not fun to eat although cheese is. The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, ""Boring!"" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."
Negative	Fun, but historically innacurate: Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book.
Negative	BORING: This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it
Negative	boring: This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression. In any case, everybody's moved over to the American model, so Orwell's scrawlings would do well to stick around on their crusty little island.
Negative	BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS TEENS WELL ANYBODY: Okay all this book was about was random sex, the destruction of human nature, and the ending of all morales. However I must admit that Orwell had a prphetic sense when it camr to the idea of being watched constantly by the government. This book lacked a decent plot as well. THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED.
Negative	Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring: As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on.
Negative	I've never thought about the affects of a book quite so much: Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it.
Negative	I just couldn't get into it.: This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it.
Negative	"School Book review: I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
Positive	Big Brother: I don't think I can say anymore about this than hundreds of other readers have already mentioned. It's a classic and rightfully so. But will Big Brother eventually take over our lives? You be the judge.
Positive	Crazy to think about: There is a lot of information and insinuations in this book - so many that I will definitely have to read it over and look deeper into Orwell's meanings. Most of it I did pick up on though and I must say that I love the story as much as I love Orwell's intentions with this book. Much more graphic of a novel than I first expected, and humorous at the most unexpected times, I know now why this is a classic novel.
Positive	Great!(:: The book was a little slow being delivered but no problems! It also came in better condition than I was expecting! (:
Positive	Most important book of the 20th century: Firstly this is a fantastic book and a fantastic read. At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons. Namely Churchill and Orwell through the main character of this book. It is an excellent exploration of the two men and really gives an idea about who they were and what they really stood for.
Negative	"Great Book, Inumerable Glaring Errors: I love this book, it was a great read.However, there are simply too many mistakes, misspellings, etc in this version. This is the very worst edition of any book I have ever read. I started highlighting the mistakes on my kindle, but there were just too many and I gave up.Add to that that the chapters are not marked, and there is no proper index.If you do buy this horrible edition, be prepared to read around an obvious error every other page or so.Some examples include:""There were four others oil the committee""""And they would sit round die table""Bottom Line: I want my money back."
Positive	Not for the simple minded and/or immature: A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book. It is useless to prescribe it to silly bobby-socksers whose minds and interests can't go beyond TV shows about spoiled teenagers and/or Most-Popular-Boy-on-Whatyamacallit-School-Team. Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ.
Positive	Looking at a future that is now past: I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience.
Positive	Wonderful Work.: Richard Brown's voice is perfect for 1984 - a novel about a distopia. I listened to this while driving to work in my car. This is a very deep, thoughtful novel to begin with. It is made so real by a good actor. I highly recommend this.
Positive	One of the greatest books ever: I literally continuously read this book for about nine months. I would finish the book in only a few days, but I absolutely loved it. I just started over and kept reading it and re-reading it. This is one of those books where the plot got better every time and even knowing the ending did not dampen the suspense. I thought this book is one of the greatest of its class ever. Orwell is a true master.
Positive	"1984 is based on ""We"" by Jevgenij Samjatin: 1984 On september the 6.th someone said that Orwell never read, and therefore was not inspired by ""We"". That is not true. I have got a rewiew of ""we"" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times."
Positive	"Frighting............: A frighting look at how the future could turn out. A world where Independent thought is a crime, because it is not sactioned by the goverment. A world where Big Brother is always right, because there is no way to prove it is wrong. A world where your kids may turn you in for being an Enemy of the State, simply because you said the words ""Down with Big Brother"". A protrait of a world that could very easily become our own unless we do everything in our power to fight it. Those who believe that Big Brother could never happen, will most likely be the first ones into Room 101. Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both once said ""Those who give up Freedom for Security, will not have, niether do they deserve, either."" 1984 is a perfect description of a society that gave up their freedom hoping for safety. Instead, they lost both, trading in the criminal in the streets, for criminals in the Halls of Government, and in essence, the innocent have become the criminals."
Positive	Imagine the image of a boot stamping a human face, forever..: Nineteen Eighty Four offers a harrowing glimpse into the totalitarian state. Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader).
Positive	"A book of prophecy about America: Someone gave me a used copy of this book when I was very young, and it sat on my bookshelf for many years before I read it. Although I found its ""science fiction"" setting to be engaging, it wasn't until my later years as an adult in the U.S. that I began to appreciate Orwell's foresight into the political future of our country.I am sure it would be controversial to conclude that we are now living under the watchful eye of Big Brother, but having read this book, I consistently do a ""double-take"" when I observe the evolving cultural and legal climate in our country. Our mainstream media may not admit that the ""thought police"" exist, but thanks to Orwell, I find myself always looking over my shoulder!"
Positive	a classic: i have read this book over and over. it never bores meno matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live inpoliticians never change and always practice the art of deception.people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely
Positive	Literally Genius, Politically Mind-Provoking: The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time. It makes us think of the world in the book, and inevitably compare it with ours. 1984 stands as one of my all-time favourite. And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16.
Positive	Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book: Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )
Negative	"Great story, poor Kindle rendition: Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the ""Kindle edition"" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."
Positive	"The truth is scary, isn't it?: I feel as though I should be shouting all the cheesy cliches: ""What a page-turner!"", ""I couldn't put it down!""; but I would hate to parallel such mindlessness with Orwell's pure genius. 1984 is an excellent story with familliar characters (the rebel, the romantic, etc.), but also much more. Orwell's accuracy surrouding both the government and the media is undeniably disturbing. This book and ""Brave New World"" have turned me on to a whole new genre of literature."
Positive	"a shattering ending to a rather slow book: Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like ""Animal Farm"" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."
Positive	"A great book, makes you believe in how good a story can be: ""Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree."" 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."
Positive	"Good if you stick with it: At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like ""doublethink"" and ""newspeak"". And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."
Positive	on my shortest list of favorites: Just to add my voice to the rest here. It's hard to overstate the combination of message, artistry, and foresight in this book.
Positive	Devestating: While the subject of this story intrigued me it also really disturbed me at the same time. I think it was an important read. Big Brother, here we are. I won't say you'll have fun from reading this book but I will say you will learn a thing or two about our world and where we are going.
Positive	BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!: When I read this story, I was amazed. Though it's written 50 years ago, you can find some things that really exist in our time. Maybe not as terrible but terrible enough. This story is a vision on the future. A future that may come sooner that we expect. I recommend this book to every book lover, this one you can't miss, and remember: Big brother is watching you!
Positive	george orwell, 1984: this is an amazing book. although it's non-fiction, it almost scares you into beleiving that you're living in their society. very thought-provoking, and very powerful. hard to believe that it was written so long ago.
Positive	"A true classic!: Orwell does a fantastic job of showing the negative effects of a utopia. He shows how ""the party"" can take over everything. They can control you, and everyone can be the same. The individual person no longer exists. His realisism portrays true possibilities of what might occur. 2 thumbs up ! Go Lakers!"
Positive	A book that gives me a new outlook on life: This book has changed my vision of natural human nature. I have found many events and characteristics of the Party to be preshadowings of organizations I see everyday. It also showed me how an evil administration can distroy a love that was so strong. This book is scary and too real.
Positive	If you read it years ago, try listening this time...: This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did.
Positive	The ideas are more important than the literature: This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in.
Positive	Hauntingly relevant: This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are.
Positive	outstanding: I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli. This is a fantastic story that is VERY easy to read, get involved in, relate to the main character, and find oneself caught in the truth of versus the appearance of reality. Excellent!!! A+
Negative	Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...: I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them.
Negative	doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews: this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book. I was excited to read it before amazon.com stole it.
Negative	to future ap worlld history students: I honestly dont like this book its just not the type of stuff i like to read. So any of you that are thinking about reading this if your favorite book is the twilight series, eragon or the vampire diaries you probably wont like it either. I only read it because i had to.
Positive	"Rough paper edges: A comment on the ""packaging"": Though the paper quality is nice, the book has rough cut edges, which for me makes the pages harder to turn. When flipping through, it's difficult to turn just one page at a time. Also, the print is a little hard to read; the font is Times style, and the thin parts of the font are much thinner than the thick parts, unusually so, making the letters harder to recognize."
Negative	"1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.: While regarded as a ""classic"" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."
Negative	It rings false.: The book has not much to say. It is just the common night-mares of its time. The contents can be discussed as a historical document.
Negative	"Rediculously boring and redundent: ""1984"" by George Orwell was extremely boring. The text was so long and unelaborate. I think that the text could have needed some more details and more drama. I have heard many good things about this book, but aparently I was dissapointed after reading this. I had expected the same great literary work as ""Animal Farm"" which I had loved and read many times in highschool. I was greatly dissapointed with the redundent and unecessary words. I would definitely not recommend this book to someone who likes drama and more elaborate text."
Negative	Orwellspeak, Sum Total Zero: George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is all catchphrases, Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak and it is absolutely rendered down to a zero summation, a monumental ode to nothingness, an ideologically streamlined state of unbelievable being.Chris Roberts(speak)
Negative	disappointed: i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve
Negative	"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Winston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
Positive	A Must Read for Literary Fiction Fans: Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again.
Positive	Gives me chills: I don't think this story really needs my review. So many people have already said everything that needs to be said. All I can say is when I was done with reading this story I felt a trembling deep inside of myself that never fully went away. There is a terrible truth here that needs to be seen.
Negative	"Orwell....just a little too far out there for me.: I thought George Orwell's 1984 was an ""ok"" book. I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people. So just because I didn't think the book was that fantastic, don't let that stop you. I would advise you to read this book to see if Orwell's depiction of this strange negative utopia is for you."
Negative	"1984: I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now ""drones"" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind. Still curious as to the outcome as I forgot the ending. More when completed.Would I recommend this book? depends, but not for everyone...I liked reading ""The Help"" better with the character interactions..."
Negative	Book was not trimmed: The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
Negative	bad service: really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers.
Positive	Ageless classic: I had seen the movie based on this book years ago. The book has as much meaning in this day and age as it did when it was written.I was captivated by how stark, dirty, dingy, and hopeless the main charcter's view of the world is, even when trying to rebell.I think it's a very insightful look into just where a society can go. Even one with the best of intentions. It's very applicable in this era.
Positive	"Orwell's Greatest Work!: I have read everything Orwell has ever penned, even his essays, and this is by far his best piece of work. The efficiency of his prose, the imaginative use of language that has become part of our daily lexicon (how many times have you used the term ""Big Brother""?). This is truly a treasure and a novel that I read at least once a year."
Positive	"Thinking Book (Review written by Muad'Dib): This is a really wierd book. In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show ""Big Brother""), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell's books you'll LOVE Animal Farm."
Positive	1984 defines our distrust for government: The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives.
Positive	1984- More than just philospohy: When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!
Positive	Captivating: Although I used to read books all the time (mostly teen series like the Baby-Sitters Club), I rarely find one these days that I can stand to read for more than 10 minutes. A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me. It doesn't matter how accurate he was about communism or whether or not communism is really bad. The fact remains that it is a wonderfully written and incredibly creative piece of work.
Positive	"wow!!!!!!!!!!!: this has got to be the greatest book i have ever read.it kept me in suspence to the very last.it can be taken on so many levels. the best thing about it is the ending, where unlike day of the triffids or any other contemperies,there is not one glimpse of hope which is better than ""they live happily ever after"" BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!!!!!"
Positive	"""Big Brother is watching you"" turns real: I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says "" tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. "" or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?"
Positive	1984: The most brilliant political treatise ever written: Brilliant, simply brilliant. I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment.
Positive	"It was a good book with an unfortunate ending.: The entire book was good up until the last chapter, at least in my opinion. Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try. However, the book was well put together overall with very strong characters and a strong plot. It's scary if ""Oceania"" ever became the world of today."
Negative	Not such a hot book: As is the custom of Barth, this book is informative but incredibly boring. The story of the Basseri is detailed and interesting but Barth has a style all his own and to say the least it is not engaging.
Positive	A hilarious roller-coaster ride thru a mixed up life!: I loved its candid, campy humor, madcap adventures, and sixties rebelliousness. Very stimulating reading! Fun!! Holly's adventures are priceless. It was great fun living the journey... Brian
Positive	"Project Samuel: I completely enjoyed this book. ""Dr Jack"" captured the current possibilities of cloning in his new book. It was hard to put it down, especially since I work in the biotechnology field. I especially love the ending (which I will not give away). You will just have to read it yourself."
Positive	Spellbinding fantasy: The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through. The author's love of baseball and it's heros is evident. I couldn't put it down, had to rush to the very satisfying finish. Looking forward to more from Polidoro.
Positive	Timely SciFi: With all the news of cloning humans lately, this book is timely, if not prescient. Jack Polidoro's scientific background and his expertise in reproductive biology show in this novel. His love of baseball is also evident. Jack has a writing style that keeps you turning the pages and will make the plot come alive.
Negative	leaves streaks - do not cover effectively: I am disappointed with this product.It is very cakey and do not cover blemishes more then my regular make up.It leaves streaks which looks really unattractive.I also find it hard to apply.
Negative	not to good: doent cover goo at all to me very light coverage wont buy it again sorry to say good day.. bye
Positive	Covers Redness: Bought this to disguise redness occurring with rosacea. It does a good job when used over a moisturizer and primer covering the redness but not cracking. Recommend using it with a primer and moisturizer.
Positive	Won't ever be without this product!: I've been using this product for a few years now and cannot imagine ever being without it. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and the difference after applying this product is remarkable. I HIGHLY recommend it.
Positive	Best Concealer: I love this concealer. It covers everything and blends well with makeup. Can also be worn alone. Cover your problem areas and go.
Positive	love it!: I always have a hard time finding a concealer that is just right. But this concealer I found years ago, and I've been using it ever since! I have dark bags under my eyes and this concealer helps lighten them up. Definitely recommend it!
Negative	Don't be fooled: I had high hopes for this product and I was completely disappointed. If you like wearing makeup that looks very obvious, then this is your product. It was very cakey and did not cover anything unless is was piled on in multiple layers- which looks really attractive. Plus it always came squirting out of the tube without being squeezed. I ended up throwing it away in the garbage where it belonged.
Positive	Amazing!!!!: Just purchased this product and was totally amazed!!! I have tried so many differect concealer products and was disappointed each time with their efficacy. The first time I used ColorBlend, I knew I'd finally found what I have been searching for. It conceals so well, and looks so natural. Thank you ColorBlend.
Negative	I'm probably doing something wrong. =(: I have yet to find a concealer that I am happy with. I have really dark under eye circles and this does camouflage them somewhat, but not how I had hoped. Instead of covering them, it seems to change their shade. Kind of like as if I were painting and rubbed white paint on a black spot, turning it grey. Get what I mean? It also looks really CAKEY! It could be because I have really dry skin, but not even with moisturizer + primer does it stop looking cakey.I'm returning this for my money back. That's primarily why I bought it here. I'm going to try Eve Pearl's salmon concealer in my shade, as well as Shiseido's concealer. Hopefully I'll find one I like.
Positive	Hope seasons 5 and 6 come out soon: I love this show! I ordered seasons 5 and 6 in July of 2011. Maybe the DVDs will be out in 2013.
Positive	Can someone tell me what season the Zorro episode is on?: Could one of the Bob Newhart Show fans tell me what season the episode of Bob Hartley dresses as Zorro for a masquerade party,and ends up on the ledge of of a building is included on?Thank You.
Negative	What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6: The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
Negative	Wait for a Better Release: As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided. There are still some channels broadcasting the series and even though they are the cut-up syndicated version, it was better than what I bought. Wait for someone responsible like Shout Factory to do it right.Try Hulu, it may be there.
Negative	Great for native japanese speakers: First I have to say I am disappointed that I ended up buying a Drama Audio CD instead of a OST. While I love the Karin Anime, spending the money on something I do not fully understand is a bit aggravating.All that aside, I'm sure the CD will be a treat to listen to. It unfortunately means my imagination will be in overdrive most of the time trying to create some semblance of what is happening.If you are a devoted Karin fan who likes collecting Japanese Audio Drama CDs, this is for you.If you're looking for the actual Background Music to the Karin series, you'll have to look elsewhere. You could start with www.play-asia.com. However, with Amazon.com always updating and changing, you may be able to find what you're looking for.Enjoy! ^_^
Negative	Chibi Vampire Review: This CD is not the music but a Drama CD. It basically has skits from the anime on it.Karin
Positive	Great combination for camping...: I recently took this on my last camping trip. Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary. What was useful was the light that gave me a bright led that helped keep my tent lit when getting ready for bed. When I did try out the fan I was impressed by the air that came thru. Although my experience is more with the light I would say this is a necessary purchase for anyone taking a camping trip.
Negative	stan larano: wish it had ac cord,batteries on high only last a few hours no good for my purpose,won't go overnight.......good for a few hours outdoors.......Wenzel LED Fan Light
Negative	Don't waste your money!!: Wenzel is a good name, so I bought this fan based on their reputation! This fan is hurting their reputation, what a waste of plastic!! I agree with the other reviewer, you'll do better by fanning yourself.
Negative	"Weak compared to the competition: Pros: Uses 6 AA batteries which gives it a long life (about 9 hours with NiMH rechargables) in a fairly compact size. I did not see the problems that others have reported with the light not turning off or shoddy construction.Cons: The breeze it produces is fairly weak and diffuse. It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5"" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters. I thought the built-in light on the Wenzel would be nice but it seems that I usually don't want the fan and light pointing in the same direction. It would make more sense to have a separate light."
Negative	CRAPPY FAN, DECENT LIGHT....: I ordered this fan for a recent camping trip, and never got to use the fan. I had it set up at the foot of my inflatable mattress, and one of my kids tipped it over accidentally. The fan detached from it's base, and I wasn't going to perform surgery on it during my vacation. The light on it is pretty bright, and we did use it throughout the trip. I'm sure there are much better, more durable fans out there.
Positive	great fan: I frequently attend scrapbook retreats and crops and am very hot natured - so I ordered this fan for those occassions and it is great and the light on the top of it is an added bonus
Negative	A Real Disappointment: This fan is a colossal waste of money - it's not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. When the tent got hot, the poor performance of this fan was a real disappointment.
Negative	Save your money!: I ordered two of these fan/lights. I wanted them for the fan.With the first one, the light wouldn't turn off. I had to remove the batteries when not using the fan. With the second one, the batteries only lasted two-and-a-half hours. Six batteries should have lasted longer.
Negative	It hardly puts out any air: I can't recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn't actually get any thing done. Well if i had to say some thing nice about it that would be it has a nice LED light in there. So in conclusion don't waste your money on this product get a better reviewed one instead.
Positive	Ideal answer to a power outage: This is the 2nd Wenzel LED Fan Light we have purchased from Amazon.My wife has severe asthma and during a spring power outage from a storm, the lack of air circulation bothered her until we remembered the first of these fans we had purchased earlier.We checked with Amazon for a second one and it arrived just in time to help us in a second power outage from a summer storm. Therefore I highly recommend these not only for camping, but for the type of emergency use we have experienced.
Positive	Great Fan/Light: My husband took his LED Fan Light on RAGBRAI (Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) and was really impressed with and so were all of his friends. It withstood his tent blowing down and being ruined in a storm in the middle of the night.
Negative	DON'T BUY: This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!
Positive	Good Gun case: Pretty good gun case. I use it to hold 2 handguns and a kel-tec sub 2000(small rifle that folds in half). I can put all the guns on the top level then all the magazines and other items on the bottom level. Case closes tight and nothing moves around. The only bad is that the locks are useless, the key dose not fit well and it is hard to lock/unlock. I have just stopped using the lock, which would be a problem around children.
Negative	pathetic: Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her.
Negative	"Pointless Movie!!: I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
Negative	Movie sucks: This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s. It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
Negative	Save your money.: I am a big fan of foreign movies. When I read read the reviews listed here, I decided to see this movie before buying the DVD. Thank goodness. The storyline was terrible.
Negative	one of the worst Cannes winners: That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry.
Negative	The Worst Movie Of All Time: This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie.
Negative	Are you kidding me?: I watched this film a few years ago, and like The Secretary, it was a truly bad film. Sick and extremely disturbing, not to mention boring. I must've fell asleep 10 times while watching this film. I could've made a better movie. Not recommended.
Negative	A real downer: If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. If you like true tragedies, then I think it would be a good film. The acting is quite good. At one point the main character tries to make love to her own mother. The whole movie was just too disturbing for me.
Positive	From A Music Teacher!: This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians.
Negative	Not What I Expected Or Even Close: The acting was good for what it was. The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was. The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.
Positive	Classical music and sado-masochism...: ...who would have thought they could co-exist? This movie is criticized as being devoid of content, except for it's graphic sexual and violent content. I would disagree with this viewpoint. I think of it more as a study of mental illness. The film is highly unpredictable and very well made. I loved the music in the film as well. I personally didn't get the impression the filmmaker was attempting to make any broad-sweeping philosophical statements or moral pronouncements, as its critiques on this website are suggesting. Its simply a bizarre, somewhat disturbing movie that is very well made and interesting.
Negative	"Misses the Mark: I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these ""critically acclaimed"" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying ""What?"""
Negative	Beyond Weirdness: This subtitled film portrays the emotional deterioration and sexual perversions of an otherwise gifted and attractive professor of music. Includes scenes of mother-daughter incest, genital self-mutilation, suicide and recurrent sadomasochism. Despite all of this rarely seen pathology, this is very little excitement or entertainment value inherent in this film. Needless-to-say, a bit on the depressing side.
Negative	Quite funny: Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. Incredible performances, but I'd rather curl up with the cat and watch 'Roman Holiday'. Life's too short to roll around in the John.
Negative	repugnant at best: Well-acted for the most part, it was a relief to turn this movie off. The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape. This is one of those ugly movies that defiles the consciousness of its viewers with no higher purpose - artistic or philosophic. Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer.
Negative	Pretentious bore: Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie.
Negative	I think I'll go back and hide behind Clementi: I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music. I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was.
Positive	Mostly quite good.: The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents. I bought two copies as gifts for colleagues who just started their careers as elementary school principals, and they liked it as well. As with most books regarding education topics, there are some things that are utopian, such as encouraging parents to contact you at home making relations so much better.
Positive	Difficult Parents quality: This text was in good shape, no bent pages, marks, etc. It also came quickly before I needed it for my class...and I'm based in China too. So was a good purchase overall!
Negative	Doen't fit to DCR-PC55: This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It won't fit into the camcorder. The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50.The information about the battery is misleading. It states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55, which is not correct. This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55's battery bay.
Negative	It's not evil, it's just pretty boring: Giving Sarah a lift from Loch Ness to London, the TARDIS picks up a distress signal and the Doctor lands the ship on Zeta Minor, a planet on the very edge of the universe. On this planet, an expedition seeking a new energy source has lost all but one of its members.However, when the Morestran Empire rescue expedition arrives, the Doctor and Sarah are prime suspects as the mysterious killers. But the planet has a very large secret, one which threatens the whole universe...'The Planet of Evil' is one of those Doctor Who serials that so many people seem to love, but which leaves me cold (perhaps not a surprise, as it was written by Louis Marks, who also wrote 'Inferno', which falls into the same category. Novelisation hasn't greatly improved the story in my eyes, and deprives us of the wonderful Zeta Minor jungle set.If you like 'Inferno', you'll probably like this one far more than me.
Positive	One Of My Wife's Favorites: My wife really loves this movie, and I was happy to buy it for her for Valentine's Day. It seemed an appropriate gift, since the movie is essentially a love story. As I hoped, she loved it, along with the chocolates and mushy card. That said, in my opinion, Alec Guinness is completely unconvincing as an oriental, even though he is one of the most celebrated actors of all time. Couldn't they have found a real Chinese guy to play the part? But the cantankerous Rosalind Russell was perfect for her role, and played it to the hilt. I can't say I'm a fan of the movie, but because of my wife's love of it, it was a big hit at our house.
Negative	Unbelievable: This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. It fails utterly. Guinness is badly miscast, looking about as Japanese as, say, Robert Morley. Rosalind Russell is barely plausible as a Jewish mother. The movie lacks wit, humor, sophistication, action, and suspense. It's basically a soap opera with lots of preaching about the brotherhood of man (oops, humankind). It's no surprise to me that the film has not been released on DVD. No one needs to waste time like that. Put this one in your Turkey book.
Negative	BUYERS BEWARE! BOOTLEG OFFERING: This film has not been issued on DVD. This listing was created by a bootlegger, selling home-made copies.
Positive	DON'T TOUCH MY MOUSTACHE: I love this movie! It is a tender and funny movie. Rosalind Russell (Mrs. Jacoby) shares her jewish traditions with a Japanese gentleman while in Japan. It is about how racism can be overcome by gentle understanding. How graceful times were. Truly a gem!
Negative	"Beware DVD-R copies: This is the second time I have ordered a movie manufactured ""on demand"" in a DVD-R format from Amazon.com. My Sony DVD recorder/player is less than two years old. When I attempted to play each movie on the Sony, this message was displayed: ""Error. This disk cannot be played"". I have never had problems with movies that are manufactured directly by the studio so I assume that the middleman responsible for making these DVD-R copies is unreliable. Anyway, I am very disappointed."
Positive	Finally on dvd: I have been waiting for this movie to hit dvd for years.I was surprised by the price .You can get this movie fromWarner Bros website for only $19.95.Why is Amazon making us by this dvd from a second party?When I get this dvd I will write a review.The wb website says this dvd has NOT been digitally remasteredfor this dvd.Hope this helps
Negative	A Majority of One DVD-R movie: If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. Instead it should be made on a dual layer DVD disk because it is over two hours. This DVD-R disk must therefore be less quality than standard play playback. Not good for High Definition flat screens, especially the larger size screens. By the way, this movie was broadcasted by Turner Classic Movies in letterboxed form. The TCM broadcast movie differed from the movie I had on prerecorded VHS tape. The TCM movie plot was better than what was on the VHS version. Also the TCM version was in widescreen and more sharp than the VHS version. The source of where this DVD version came from which you are selling is NOT provided and that is one more reason why I won't buy it. Sincerely, Rick Gershon.A Majority of One
Positive	"A dear old friend: Never mind that Alec Guinness plays a Japanese businessman. He does so well, you forget after awhile that he doesn't look Japanese.This film, which came out in the very early 60's I think, is based on a play by Leonard Spiegelgass. Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its ""modernity,"" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I'm so glad this film has finally been put on DVD."
Positive	"a majority of one: I've loved this movie forever...watched my old VHS so much that it was beginning to look like a moth eaten rug!As 'Bertha' says [played by Rosiland Russell], ""It's like a Travel-log!""...a very interesting peek at the post-WWIIprocess of Japanese/American cultural assimilation as seen from the American perspective.Being a 'Trekkie' forever, too...see if you can 'spot' a young George Takei! And, Mr Takei reported in his marvelousAutobiography that Sir Alec Guinness had an awful Japanese 'accent'... to which I say = unless you're Japanese,you'll never know it....It's just great Guinness, great Russell, great Takei, other great character actors = a marvelous film!I decidid to 'treat' myself to a new movie...DVD this time...for many more years of enjoyment!"
Positive	"""A Majority of one"": I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
Positive	A Majority Of One: This movie is a Classic! So Glad to have found it:) They just don't make movies like this any more.
Positive	A Majority of One: This movie is just wonderful. Very enlightening, entertaining and humorous. Helps people understand boundaries. I have watched it several times and so have some of my friends. Highly recommend.
Positive	A Majority of One: This is one of my favorite movies. Rosalind Russell and Alex Guinness are just wonderful in it. Great movie!! I am so glad that is finally available on DVD. Thank you Amazon.
Positive	Please someone stop me thinking that Green Thoughts is GREAT: I found this cd through some random thrift shop pillaging and have been praising the heavens ever since. Green Thoughts is one of those albums that are so amazingly catchy and beautiful to the ears you have to listen to it on repeat ten-thousand times over.The tracks on Green Thoughts focus around heartache but despite their emo-esque titles (i.e. Drown In My Own Tears, Deep Black, If The Sun Dosen't Shine) its amazingly accessible 1987 vibe puts across more than just the loneliness of a relationship gone sour. Green Thoughts is The Car's with soul and and Elvis Costello with power chords.If you happen to be looking for an album with some beautiful melody and heartfelt lyrics, Green Thoughts is where it's at. It really is incredible.
Positive	Great band!: Video killed the Radio Star. If this music came out in 1968, this band would have been a headline act. However in the MTV world, if your not pretty, you don't play. I recommend these guys to everyone.
Positive	"Variedad: Bueno tener este album debido a su sonido peculiar, algunas de sus canciones hasta fueron programadas aca en la radio en Guanatos...es + el Kala (Rostros Ocultos) se encargó de hacer un cover el cual fue un exito en español - con los Smithreens nunca lo fue - (""Tiempo de Cambiar"" o ""Something New""). Saludos de neta. Mork"
Negative	Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!: This CD set is false advertising. On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road.
Negative	Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children: This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.
Negative	"""monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close"": I kept getting the following error on Windows 2000""monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close"" when launching Disney/Pixar's Mike's Monstrous Adventure (Windows 2000)All my drivers are the latest. Do see what the problem was and the Disney website is of no help. I may have to return the product if I dont get this working"
Negative	It didnt work: I kept getting an error message when trying to install it. I ended up having to return it unfortunately. sorry
Negative	"Not a very positive book: I bought this book to read to my son's first grade class for Valentine's Day. I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne ""investigates"" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable."
Negative	"0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!: This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. ""Tower of Blood"" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"
Negative	the bottom below the false bottom of the barrel: This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it. No scares, no suspense, nuthin. Rock bottom.
Negative	"One star and that is being gracious!: Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."
Negative	"More like ""Tower of Feces""!!!: This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."
Negative	not proof read: This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book.
Negative	Had to return it: Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn't charge it without the cycle turning itself off. The size & fit were good; it just wouldn't take a charge.
Negative	Doesn't warm bottles: Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product.
Negative	doesn't work for me: I have regular avent bottles, and I seriously need to warm the bottle up for 30 mins just to take thechill off, the. Warmer gets hot, it just doesn't warm the bottle up....I would not use this warmer for avent bottles imo
Negative	to long to warm: where to begin, this product takes atleast 10 to 15 minutes to warm up a 4ounce bottle, and anyone with a small infant that is hungry knows this is entirely to long, would not recomment this to new parents at all, I now take a reusable bottle and fill with hot water and use that to warm up bottles
Negative	It doesn't even get warm to the touch, much less heat a bottle!: We got this for on the go use and it doesn't even warm up to the touch. It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :(
Negative	"it is a joke: this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say "" forever"", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W. If you do the math, you know the energy the warmer produces may take forever to reach the heat to warm a bottle up."
Negative	WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!: I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. I plugged this in and waited almost 20min with a screaming baby and the formula was almost as cold as it was when I started. Huge waste of money!!!1
Negative	Don't overheat your bottle!: The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer.
Negative	I'd pass on this one: This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!
Negative	Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles: I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles.
Negative	So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!: Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
Negative	Didn't warm at all!!: It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!
Negative	Don't waste your money: I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!
Negative	Takes FOREVER: I noticed some reviews saying this bottle warmer got so hot, it started fires. Well in our case it didn't. We got this because we had a newborn the week of Thanksgiving, and it gets really cold here between Oct-March, and being on the go frequently for the holidays, thought it would be a nice convenience to heat bottles in the car. After 45 minutes, the bottle wasn't even room temperature. I could have gotten it hotter placing it in my hands, or between my thighs. I thought maybe it wasn't placed correctly and didn't depress the activation button, gave it a few more tries but it never worked well.With the unpredictability of this product, between fire-starting the other reviews have stated and not even doing a darn thing in my case, I wouldn't get it. Very disappointed because now with 3 kids all under the age of 3, I have grown to like the Munchkin brand, but they really dropped the ball on this one.
Positive	Chilling & Fast Paced: As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox & Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller.
Negative	"My daughter think this is fun,but not that fun: I bought this for my daugher on her birthday she liked the doll, but she did not love it. She said, ""it was fun she enjoyed doing her hair,but it was not hat fun."""
Positive	adidas: was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50.8 version. Thus far it feels good and i would definately recommend the use of this product
Positive	I guess Cali Iz Active: Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop put out a pretty impressive album which starts out great with the self named track Cali Iz Active. After that the lyricism and delvery is pretty good but not the best it could be. This album is still very impressive though with some great beats and appearances by some of the best in the business. Overall this album is better than Young Joc and his attempt at rap or other wannabe rappers from the ATL. This album is definitely worth your money.
Negative	Tha Dogg Pound: This album absolutely sucked. They are still living off of Dr. Dre's scraps from '94. Seriously ever since Snoop sold out and became some wanna be 1970's style pimp, he has dropped off the map as far as importance to the rap game. Kurupt and Daz still have a little bit in the tank, but not enough to warrant buying this album. Anyone who says this album is good is only kidding themselves. Best advice: Keep away from this one and buy something else.
Negative	Cali iz inactive: Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album.
Negative	title track was cool&then the rest is a Coaster: Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but they lost there Groove long ago. the flows are tired&there are too many hands on the Production end. seems to be going through the motions&hoping to catch somebody feeling the vibe,but you just can't recapture where things were at back in the day. Snoop is just hall passing these days so him being on cruise control here comes as no suprise.
Positive	Impressive: I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!
Negative	Save your money: I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped.
Negative	"Don't bother buying this one: After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a ""menu decoder"" when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books. Try to find something else."
Positive	"A lot of useful info in a very small book: This is a very compact book, easily carried in a shirt pocket. Which makes it all the more impressive considering the amount of information that is contains. My only real complaint of the book is that though it is organized into sections like ""checking into a hotel"" or ""ordering food"" it can sometimes be difficult to find the phrase you are looking for at the time you need it. However, after having made a few trips to Thailand now, I now realize how good this book is. What I would recommend is that you read through the book before you travel and highlight key phrases you think you might use. Normally, for a phrasebook that might be painful to try to read through it, but this book has a lot of interesting information on Thai culture, customs, food, history, etc. that it isn't simply a list of phrases or a dictionary. And if you are like me and a little slow to pick up languages, you will find the book even more useful after a few trips to Thailand."
Positive	america the Beautiful: this book works great for teaching the song. The hardback cover is great for multiple uses.
Positive	Beautiful book!!: The illustrations are just beautiful, I will use the book to teach my students the beautiful song of the same title.
Positive	It has wondeful illustrations.: The book has good illustrations and it has the song five times. The illustrations go very nicely with the words to the song.
Negative	"It really had potential, but....: Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."
Negative	A harlequin romance set a sex club: I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq.
Positive	Good Book!: I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own. If you are a fan, I would recommend adding this one.
Positive	"~ Erotic Fantasy ~: This is a lovely erotic fantasy. There are glimpses of BDSM but it is not ""hardcore"".Do not compare this book to the movie of the same name ~ The movie version is camped up & changed to make the story light & funny ~ The actual story in this book is not light and not funny, it is more of a complicated romance, between two people who don't realize how much they need each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hopefully, you will too ~ and if you do, you may seriously want to pick up the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy."
Negative	"Only if you liked the Movie: If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is ""doing him""."
Positive	hot: Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library. Other favorites are her Sleeping Beauty series. Definitely not for the prudish. She has the ability to pull you in and connect to the characters. I couldn't put them down!
Negative	"Needs more to it.: I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
Negative	Trashy: I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it.
Negative	Not what I expected: This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there.
Positive	"A glimpse into the real world of s/m play.: An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible ""players"". Don't try this one at home!"
Positive	"An erotic love story for Nineties.: I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious ""happy ending"" reasons but also for the ""bring you back down to earth"" feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day."
Negative	"Dissapointing: Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. This story I found to be much to long and tedious. The concept of a ""bondage vacation "" was much to comical and contrived. If erotica is what you want to read pick up an Anais Nin book. Anybody that can read her work without starting to get a rapid heartbeat is gotta be senseless!!"
Positive	Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD: A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!
Negative	Not her best work.: I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here.
Negative	"One erotic passage in the entire book.: I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the ""Club"". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."
Negative	I was extremely disappointed!: The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it.
Negative	One Of The Worst Anne Rice Books!: I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!
Negative	some books suffer from abridgement: The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also.
Negative	Not what I expected...: This book wasn't what I expected; never read an Anne Rice, but after reading what others had written, thought I'd buy a book of hers.Should have saved my money; this story was too far-fetched. Didn't finish it.
Negative	What was this....trash is what it is!!: I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!
Negative	"Disallusion: I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men ""whipping"" someone for reasons I can't fathom. To dicipline, arouse ,or to train them; it escapes me. Too 'kinky' for my taste. In all fairness, I never made it past the first few chapters either in this book or the first of Sleepy Beauty's triology. The theme was obvious. I will assume there is a message in these books but I didn't care to find it. I gave this 1 star because it was required to submit the review. Rereading this, this review DOES make me SOUND like a prude! In synopsis, if you like whips and chains and that sort of thing, you like the book; if not don't waste your money. I don't even want to donate them to our local library."
Negative	"Not Sleeping Beauty: I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her ""Sleeping Beauty"" series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."
Negative	Let down...: It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels.
Negative	"Pathetically bad!: This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's ""Something Leather"""
Positive	Magical Adventure: Anita Jeram's book, I Love My Little Storybook, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. The illustrations are magical and whimsical. As a reader or a listener, it's easy to wish yourself into this magical world of adventure. It's a wonderful bedtime story and has become a favorite to give as a gift to other children and expectant mothers.
Positive	Vexx is very good: I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(...). Like many of the reviews have already mentioned, this game is excellent! Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete.
Positive	"Great Game: This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard! You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way. You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line ""poems"" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated ""T"" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it."
Negative	cheap cheap cheap...: I fell in love with the print on a set of 250 thread count Tommy Hilfiger sheets, so I bought two sets of twin size at $15.99 for each sheet. I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste.
Negative	The title gives it away: A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history.
Negative	Wax coating and taste: I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I'm missing out on something. The Zoe bars are a major disappointment. The roof of my mouth feels like it is coated with a grainy wax when I finish eating the bars. Unless you enjoy wax, spend your money on many good alternative bars and skip the Zoe's.
Positive	Lose Weight, Feel Better, Eat Right, Get Omega 3's and More: I am absolutely addicted to this flavor as well as all of the other bar flavors. This is my breakfast, afternoon pickup or even sometimes my on the go lunch! I am never hungry when I eat my Zoe's Bars!
Negative	Not a fan of these: I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually.
Negative	Didn't like them: The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. And there really is only a slight chocolate flavor, with a strange aftertaste. They are filling though, but then again so is eating compressed cardboard!
Positive	spirited: My brother lives in Bangkok and I've been there many times so I was keen to see what a novel set there would be like and I wasn't disappointed - Mr Moore evokes the seediness and poverty without it appearing soul-destroyingly hopeless because he manages to balance it with interesting characters (both the good, the bad and the humanly flawed), a good mystery and moments of beauty and humour. I enjoyed it and intend to try the next one...
Negative	"Gets better over time: I almost gave up reading this book after a couple of chapters for the same reasons as the 1-star reviewers. I can't say I care for the writing style. It reminds me of the ""Guy Noir"" skit on ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which is, of course, supposed to be a funny take-off on these kinds of books. The protagonist seemed to be more of a stereotypical formula rather than a real person. I struggled up through Chapter 9. Then I began to get more invested in the story. I think the writing began to improve a bit and the characters gained some dimension. Still, it ends up being 2 stars for me. Perhaps his later books are better?"
Negative	One of the worst books I've ever read....: I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible. I can't believe that I wasted my time reading that much of the book.
Negative	"So bad: This is simply terrible... It is badly written, a ""cutsy"" attempt to be the typical hard-boiled detective. Not even worth the free download."
Negative	sorry....: Sorry, I couldn't get into this one at all. If you want to read some GOOD thrillers located in Bangkok, try John Burdett's books beginning with Bangkok 8.
Negative	What the heck is up with this cover?: 'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?
Negative	The worst book ever written.: Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would.
Negative	"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read: This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."
Positive	Wonderful feminist novel: This is a great, imaginative book, one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
Negative	"Not Deserving of its Clout: I know that ""Herland"" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend ""Herland"" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at ""social housekeeping"" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."
Negative	Wrong book: wrong book sent. Customer service was poor and presented an extremely difficult procedure for correcting the problem. I was required to pay to send the book back, mailing back cost almost as the book itself. Even complying with this process did not ensure a replacement, but only that the order would be checked.
Positive	Good book but took forever to get to me: I ordered this book in March and did not receive it until June, way too long to wait for a book. The book itself is great, when it finally arrived it was in good condition. This book was recommended by one of my college professors for people who were interested in more of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works, and is basically a utopian society novel.
Positive	"A sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child: ""A Campfire for Cowboy Billy"" is not only a charming tale, it's a resonant one. Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."
Negative	"This book is hard to understand: This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."
Negative	Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding: If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet.
Negative	takes a wrong turn: fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared.
Negative	Skip 451: Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed.
Negative	Hated it: could not stand this book. hated everything about it. waste of my time reading it. maybe just too out of date for today.
Negative	Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz: This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again.
Positive	If you want action, dont read this: If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases.
Negative	blah: I had to read this for school. The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class. Montag's wife was annoying to me and Bradbury's ideas are really intersting. Too bad he can't write his way out of a paper bag. This book was a waste of time. Never read it unless its required and theres a test on it. Then you could make an exception, I guess.
Negative	"This book is not ""hot."": I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew ""Fahrenheit 451"" was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Well, I hated it. I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help! Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible? There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either! I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently. I do not recommend this book!"
Negative	fahrenheit 451: the book has a good theme but it just dragged on. i did not like this book. montag is stupid to revolt in the first place he knows its the law and he knows what will happen to him if he does. Why did clarisse die there was no point to that just one day mildred said she was dead and montag was like oh ok it was lame and boring. i recomend this book to no one.
Negative	In My Opinion....: Fahrenheit 451 lists in my top 5 of worst books ever. my english class had to read it. i didnt even read the lastsection. by the time the first test rolled around, i hadnt even read 10 pages. i evenually forced myself to read it but stopped when i got to last section cause i thought if i read anymore, i might die. i felt no connection to the characters, no emotion towards them. Everything is drawed out way to much. when he could easly say something in a couple pages, he takes like 50 to tell one little minor thing. For me, its really boring and stupid. For u, many ur will like it. Maybe not. Cant no until u attempt to read it(NOTE: i said attempt)
Negative	Bad written - Wasted money: I think this book isn't worth the money you pay for it. Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it.
Negative	The usual dreck: I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!
Negative	"This book was very boring: I had to read this book for school, and it is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are three sections, and all that the main character, Montag does in the first section is meet a girl named Clarisse and talks to her once or twice and starts ""considering"" his job as a fireman burning books. This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring. There are so many metaphors and stuff that it is so hard to understand the story.While I hated this book, if you're the kind of person who likes sci-fi books with a lot of metaphors, then you should read Fahrenheit 451."
Negative	"Read this book ..... if you want a good nap!!: Before I was forced to read this book by my eigth grade reading teacher, I had heard from people that it was pretty amazing and thought provoking. They were wrong. The only credit I can give this book is that it is the only one that has ever made me fall asleep. Its inconsistent plot and awful use of surreal events were written down in a rambling, incoherent jumble of thoghts, even if you can call them that. Even if it had any type of meaning or hidden morale, this supposed ""work of art"" was unbearably boring and slow. Maybe I'm not yet old enough to be able to pick out any real substance from the book's paragraph after paragraph of *@#$, but I do applaud anyone who had the strength to get past the first chapter. I end my review with some ""poetic justice"" of my own... I burned this book!!!"
Negative	This book sucked: This book sucked. I am forced to read this for my 9th grade accelerated english class and it is boring. You can guess what's gonna happen next throughout the whole book. It makes no real attempt to make a statment on book burnings.
Negative	"Please burn THIS book!!!: Too bad this book wasn't included among Montag's targets during his career as a ""fireman."" He sure would have done us all a big favor by sparing us the agony of trying to trudge through this trash. Life is too short ... don't waste one minute with this no-brainer!"
Negative	DONT READ THIS BOOK: Ray Bradbury tries to write a bestseller in this boring novel. He keeps the audience in the book for about three pages, then everyone falls asleep. If he could do it again, I think he should have never written books in the first place.
Negative	This book is boring!: This book doesn't deserve a maximum of 1,000 words! It is pointless and inconsistent. Don't read it! How could our society ever become one not dependent on books for knowledge and wisdom?
Negative	this book was awful: This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
Negative	A Bad Book: The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest.
Negative	This book was really odd..........: This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
Positive	Fahrenheit 451 was a good book but hard to follow: I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge. I had a very hard time putting the book down. Fahrenheit 451 was a lot like our socity today. Instead of putting out fires firemen started them. That strange twist was what I liked most about the book. I deducted a half star because it was a little hard to follow.
Positive	"Reality check in a world that needs it: It's amazing how a book that was written nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any reader, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder ""what makes this such a good book?"" I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"
Positive	Among the Best Ever: Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it. If you can only read one book your entire life, make it this one. It is the masterpeice of the modern era from the man I would consider its finest writer.
Positive	Fahrenheit: This is perhaps the most thought provoking book I have ever read. Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar.
Positive	The Hearth and the Salamander: A future in which books are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn.
Positive	The Hearth and the Salamander: Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots.
Positive	"Scarier than LIFE: Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society. We have everything ever dreamed of, and we have barely begun. By letting ""..451"" into you're mind, one realizes that this fiction, is not justly so. It is apparent in our realm that this fable has already begun to happen. Change is something not always noticed. However, this book opened my eye's to to the world around me. I am certain, that ""Guy Montag"" the charachter, is in all of us. Just waiting to be discovered."
Positive	Censorship has never felt so real...: This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is.
Positive	Critical View: Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy.
Positive	Is this where we're headed?: Another book I read as a young man and dismissed. The book is so spot on. The difference is people tend to be obsessed with PDAs not walls in their homes.
Positive	"A Scary Preview of the future of American Society: I first read this book after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting ready to have her students read Farenheit 451. I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read ""Farenheit 451"" and see for yourself. It is a definite eye opener that sends chills thorugh my body everytime I read it."
Positive	Great Book: The author did a great job. It is a Very high reading in my opinion. Little complex storyline, but very great story!
Positive	Fascinating!: I started writing sci fi because of this book. Actually had the honor of seeing Ray Bradbury speak- LIVE - (yea, I know, it was eons ago) - but I hadn't read anything he had written before that speech. I got a copy of this book shoved into my chest just after that speech, and couldn't put it down. A marvelous read. And a must read for anyone who wants to understand how things can go wrong in society, and to get a glimpse of the cleverness of the human spirit. I'd say this is a must read for everyone!
Positive	Good book: This is definitely a well written book. It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK.
Positive	"Amazing: I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the book interesting for me. Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using ""firemen"" to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."
Positive	I generally liked this book.: This book is exceptional in its portrayal of the future. Yet, it is slow for the few chapters. If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!
Positive	Engaging fast read: Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments.
Positive	"A Classic...: After reading ""The Time Machine"" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything ""upsetting"" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."
Positive	An Eye-opener: This book is so relevant to today that it is scary. It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books.
Positive	Fiction?: I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it.
Positive	Insightful: It is simply amazing how, for a book written so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age...It does make you wonder...and makes you more aware of your own behaviors.
Positive	good..: I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books....
Positive	"Not 1984: I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called ""The end of all Utopias"" because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"
Negative	eBooks: In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper.
Negative	Useless that text to speech is not enabled!: Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per
Negative	Target Practice: Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read. A worthless good for nothing piece of junk! Actually it is good for something. I took this book with me to rifle practice and i shot at this instead of the target. I got busted but hey it was worth it. Mail me if you want a picture of my shooting.
Negative	A very disappointing book: I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence.
Negative	The Worst Book Ever!: Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!
Negative	Horrible book: This was the worst book I've ever read. Most of the book was just saying the exact same thing a million different ways. It was an interesting idea behind the book, but it was altogether boring the way it was written.
Positive	"wake-up call: Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their ""ideas"" or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged,"" McCrae's ""Bark of the Dogwood,"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"") ""Fahrenheit 451"" took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as ""fiction."" How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."
Positive	"Orwell's shadow: 'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to ""help"" the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"
Negative	I know it's a classic, but I was not impressed.: Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did.
Negative	"ATTENTION TEACHERS!: I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School. It's no wonder, with book selections like these, that students don't read and are illiterate."
Negative	CD Fahrenheit 451: I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. I placed this order on Jan. 10. Time to get the order came and went. Here it is Feb. 7, and I still do not have the CD of Fahrenheit 451. Is this company located on the moon? Why is it taking SO long for my order to get here? I am MOST displeased. I will never order anything from this company CheapBks4U again. This service is atrocious.
Positive	Timeless Classic!: Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic.
Positive	Optimistic as humans can be, but well thought.: The book was one of the best that I have ever read yet, it is the same mumbo jumbo that humans will always find th right way. That our race will always survive, conqor evils, and destroy evil doers.
Positive	RB did a great job describing why censorship is wrong: Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past.
Positive	"Simple but Perfect: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is one of those rare books that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."
Positive	"I've always had trouble reading: I've always had trouble reading but when I read this book for my English 2 class I loved it. It was a very good book. My fav line is... ""Ask not for sucurity, there never was such an animal, and if there was it would be related to the sloth which spends its time hangin upside down in a tree""""To hell with that, I say, kick the tree and knock the sloth on his @$$!"" Must READ! I wrote an essay on this book and got an A!"
Positive	A decent book, I see somwhat related to 1984: It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today.
Positive	The father of science fiction and fantasy: Great book read it when i was a teen, along with all his other books.Bought it as a gift for an aspireing writer
Positive	Great book: All theses years later this book still holds up. Loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone. Somebody should do a modern movie remake of this story.
Positive	Fantastic book!: I had to read this book while I was in high school and I'm glad I did! This turned out to be my favorite book. Great story and very thought-provoking.Highly recommended.
Positive	Ray is a philosopher.: The message is clear.Burn the words to cover-up and control society through censorship -vs- the fire for warmth, and light for learning. Let the people make up their own minds as to which helps or hinders them.Truth, actually keeps a society in a better position (no-matter how much it seems to hurt in the present) than any ideal forward pushing utopian lies...It is a great book, and Ray's real purpose/philosophy point blankly shines in the later chapters.Thats my broadbrushstroked opinion. Amazon does not offer fine lines concerning gold stars. If they did, I would rate it 4.625
Positive	This book changed the way I look at all books.: Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!
Positive	My personal worst nightmare: This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think.
Positive	Burning Books!: This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook.
Positive	How Fitting...: I'm 54 years old and I am reading this for the first time ever...on my Kindle. How very fitting, and ironic that Mr. Bradbury, who is openly against e-books, the internet and such, would agree to release Fahrenheit 451, a cautionary that centers around why real books are important, and what could happen at their demise, as an e-book.Just a thought...
Positive	"Intricate, Prophetic, Beautiful: I really loved this book. I'm sure the average reader will, too. Bradbury's prose is rich in metaphors and images and most of all, you capture his intent and feeling that he perfectly places in every moment of the book.The world the book is set it is ironically similar to ours today, and I find it kind of funny how Mildred is so incredibly similar to some people I know myself.Science Fiction is a label and this book is more of a homily. It's an important read because it asks so many questions...how does Our America compare to his?Read this book and decide for yourself...are you in progress and on track to being in a ""parlor family"" or are you curious enough to learn and love the World we live in."
Positive	FAHRENHEIT 451: A Book That Will Burn Your Mind: Fahrenheit 451. The temperature at which books catch fire and burn.Odd title, but not as odd as the story itself. The community in which this story takes place seems strange, but it's shockingly similar to our own. Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do? Find out by reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.
Negative	"Not worth reading: This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading. How wrong I was! As with many so called ""brilliant classics"" the author gets a novel idea and then tries to run with it. Unfortunately, the story fizzles out completely towards the end and the full impact of the original message dies with it. I was very disappointed with this book and wonder how people rate books like this so highly. Don't bother reading it!"
Negative	"Thoroughly Disapointed: This book is a is written about a futuristic civilization in which books are burned and anyone who is caught reading gets arrested (or worse). The main character is a ""fireman"" named Guy Montag who begins to realise that books are'nt really so bad, and he rebels. Firemen in this society don't put out fires, they burn the books. The storyline is slow and depressing. The book is rather boring, to put it politely. I believe that this is the only book that should be burned. DON'T BOTHER."
Negative	An ok book: It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451....It sets a new record in boredom.: After reading it for a school project I would avise anyone reading these reviews to stay clear of it unless your eighty and you want waste your last few months of your life. Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away.
Negative	THIS BOOKS STINKS: I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book.
Negative	BURN THIS BOOK!!!: I was FORCED to read this book in school! It was pure TRASH! I thought I liked reading... well now Idont! Thanks a lot Ray Bradbury!!!
Negative	It Deserves Negative Stars!: Last year we had to read this as a class. There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one.
Negative	fahrenheit 451: I order the book a week before it shipped and then took so long to get here I had to download the book to my daughters Kindle the night before she needed it for school. That cost me $9.99, and then got the book on the 4th or 5th of February. Won't use this one again.
Negative	"smart idea but...: Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and ""appetizing"":a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."
Negative	Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!: I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking.
Negative	Disappointed: Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn't get through this book. Perhaps I needed a teacher to help me get the symbolism!
Negative	Too obvious for even young readers: I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting.
Positive	Great buy: Great buy. The book came as described and in a timely fashion. I will order from them again.
Negative	Horrible!: I have never yet received my order, and it has been a month since I placed the order and paid for it. Will I be getting a refund of my money?
Negative	Horrible execution of an addressable topic...: This book is quite possibly the worst piece of science fiction I have read... It is dramatically boring and far too contrived to be interesting... The world Bradbury creates is thoroughly dry and I simply hated his look at the future... Nothing was at all interesting or thought-provoking, except for the books examination into the issues of censorship as a whole. I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly....
Negative	Never Received: I never received the product in the mail. Needed it for summer reading for school and had to go to the bookstore to buy it.
Negative	Horrible and boring: it is impossible to keep reading this...it is very hard to understand and most parts don't make any sense...it is very hard to understand.
Negative	How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME?: To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves. If Bradbury wanted us to realize the importance of books, the LEAST he could do was make this book SEMI-interesting! Essentially: Don't waste your time.
Negative	Not worth it: I had to read this book for school. I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me.
Negative	"Overrated!: I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't. I know that there are some good points to it, but not enought to sit and read it over and over again.PS-If you don't agree with me, please don't click the ""No"" button below."
Negative	Was not the best book i have ever read.: Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't.
Negative	A Time Waste: Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
Negative	The book is not the best!: It is not the best book I have read. It was really weird and freaky. The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was really a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like. Although this book does not fit my categories or my type of books, I would not recommend it to other people who like serious stuff.
Negative	HATED IT!: I really did not like this book! Now, don't get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. I normally like Ray Bradbury's work, too. The writing style was very repetitive and boring. I think that this is one of those books that could have been great if written differently.
Negative	Confusing: who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
Negative	Horrible: This book was way too weird for me and there was never a hook of curiosity. I was assigned to read this for school so that is the only reason i continued to read to the end. It made no sense and was very dull.
Positive	Brought it all back: My older sister had to read this book for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old. She left it sitting around and one rainy summer day back in the 70's I picked it up and was hooked. I read everything Bradbury wrote like a warm knife going through butter. My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so. Should still be required reading in our schools. Thank you Ray Bradbury for the worlds you created, they were wonderful places to visit!
Positive	Still Relevent: Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas.
Positive	A Great Read...Thank you!: Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance.
Positive	"A testament to all of the Guy Montags out there.....: This book is a classic on censorship. It also probes at human values and is almost existential in Guy's conflict over the wrong he feels is being committed in the burning of the books. This could even be a chapter out of Huxley's ""Brave New World"" in that the public is conditioned by what they can and cannot read through censorship. An essential for anyone."
Positive	perspective changer: I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book.
Positive	one of the best: This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there.
Positive	glimmery and grey: this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile.
Positive	This book burns your brain!: This excellent book captures a society unlike any other. In this world, books are outlawed. If you are caught with them, you are jailed and the books are burned. Guy Montag, who is the protaginist of the story, is a firefighter. However, instead of putting out fires, he starts them. He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything. This winds up getting him in trouble. However, in the end this works out for the best. We definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to burn their brain. For under six bucks, you can get a great thriller.
Positive	This book is a must for society: This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!
Positive	"Eye-opening & Spellbinding!!: This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who ""just don't get it"" I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!"
Positive	Interesting novel!: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!
Positive	Great Book!: I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!
Positive	"Farhenheit 451 The book about no books: Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books ""Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up. Society agrees with this because they don't want to break the law.This book's in depth descriptions are so good they pull you in and its like your there. Farenheit 451 will fill you with a new way of looking at things."
Positive	School Assignment: I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad. Besides that I enjoyed this science-fiction which has a strong resemblence to the Giver by Lois Lowry.
Positive	Good Value: This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his reading list. It was an excellent used copy and a great value for the money.
Positive	"Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, is a book that attacks what our society is becoming. Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble. Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes the reader think ""What really is important in my life?"""
Positive	"Better than I remembered: I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
Positive	Oh my goodness....: To reread these classics and then see how current and relevant it is for today is amazing. Parlor and screens, Internet and Facebook. Value of justice and human life each placed below entertainment all to be wiped clean and reset. We are all poorer at the loss of the author.
Positive	Bradbury at his best: This was Bradbury's best book. He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed.
Positive	Extremely Thought Provoking: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book. If the reader dives beneath the surface of this book, they will get a whole lot more from this book than they would from a cheesy love story.
Positive	"Alarmingly realistic: Bradbury is a master of the genre. In ""Fahrenheit 451"", he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as ""knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength"". He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie. Not to be missed"
Negative	Ultra-overrated: I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this.
Negative	Simplistic Viewpoints: While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept.
Positive	Great: This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight. Words of warning for the present and future.
Positive	Fahrenheit 451 Review: I originally purchased the Metric edition, Celsius 232.778. I was thoroughly disappointed. Reading the original was a breath of fresh air, even if it wasn't as renown by the International Organization for Standardization.
Positive	A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. I thought this book had a good plot, but it was kind of hard fo me to understand. Some of the parts of the book I had to read three or four times to figure it out. Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else.
Positive	F. 451: I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well.
Positive	Strong message and beautiful to read: I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I had heard people talk of it forever and always put it in my mind as a book to read, but I didn't think that it would necessarily be an enjoyable read. I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book. (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)So about the book... It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read. The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story. This book is pretty short. I think it is a must read for anyone. I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!
Positive	Disturbing...: One of the signs of a great book, in my opinion, is that it disturbs you - twists with your emotions and never leaves you. More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood.
Positive	Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out. This book by Ray Bradbury exposes you to why books are very important. A must read.
Positive	Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: Ray Bradbury did well done job. this book exposes you to why books are so valuable. Reading is a gift from God. If you have not read it yet, you must because you are missing out on a terrific story.
Positive	"Fahrenheit 451: I chose this book because I have read Ray's books before and enoyed them. The title seemed interesting, so I took it. His style of writing can be confusing, so you must concentrate while reading. I gave this book a ""thumbs up"" because it had an unexpected ending."
Positive	Read this book: Amazingly written!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. The book was intriguing, and suspenseful. When I read it I couldn't put it down!
Positive	Great book for today: It seemed at first that the book was too far-fetched, that It could never happen. However the more I read the more I saw connections to life today. In many ways it has been very prophetic. It basically displays what happens when a culture values convenience and comfort over honesty and truth.great read, recommend it to anyone.
Positive	Sci-fi fantasy at its best!: I read this book in 8th grade as part of a requirement. I found the book to be excellently written and with an amazing plot line. You'll despise the hound while pondering Montag. I recommend this book for ANYONE who enjoys a bit of imagination.
Positive	A confusing but exciting,well-written,and intellectual novel: A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think.
Positive	A very hot read!: Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!
Positive	"Classic audio book: The Audio book ""Fahrenheit 451"" was purchased by me as a gift for a friend who has limited eyesight. He reports that the book is of exceptional quality and very easy to use. I would recommend this book based on his comments. I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."
Positive	A point driven home by a brilliant writer: While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation.
Positive	Quick 'nd Good: A quick read with a big font, and only 170 pages, yet it was so good.A terrific story of a fireman who doesn't fit in with the rest of the group and then goes a stray.If the book has multiple introductions, prefaces or whatever only read one, (preferably the longest one) otherwise its just repetitive, though somewhat interesting.
Negative	All books begin with a premise...: ... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood.
Negative	Understanding: I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better. I suggest to read this book if you feel like you have time. If your into all that science fiction stuff then you would probably enjoy this book much more than i ever will in two lifetimes. Goodluck, you might need it!
Negative	Awful and boring: It was one of the most boring books i have ever read in my life.Why everyone in this society is so narrow-minded.Mildred is the most stupid woman i have ever read for and beatty is one of the biggest liar.So i think Bradbury was probably drunk while he was writing this book.
Negative	"A good idea gone horribly wrong!: At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
Negative	How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled: How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled. By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do. He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books. Everyone loses.
Negative	"This is not a good or bad book, but its O.K: I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read. I will not recommend this book to my friends because it's boring. ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about Guy Montag, a fireman, who starts fire but does not putout fires. In this society, the fireman has to set up fires and burn the books. Usually when we hear ""fireman"", we always think about that their job is to put out fires. It is totally different than we thought, right? This book is about censorship, that is, people does not have the right to read. In that society, the firemen have the rights to burn. Not only books, but also the houses and people. In this book, an innocent woman who has being burn in her house with her books. How can the fireman has the right to burn a human life, a human life! Especially a book lover, How?"
Negative	Disappointing. Does not deserve to be a 'classic': Length:: 3:49 MinsFahrenheit 451Fahrenheit 451: A Novel
Negative	This book stunk!: Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living.
Negative	"Turn the stove up to 451 degrees and throw this book in!: Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my ""burn this book"" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named ""GUY MONTAG"". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all ""offensive"" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the ""family"" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"
Negative	Great book, bad performance: As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process.
Positive	"Fine novel, but it's too short: Fahrenheit 451, is a fine novel. It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" or ""Brave New World"". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it's too short. It's kind of like a novella. While reading I was thinking whether there is an allusion to the tremendous fear or reds and the communists during the 50's in the U.S.?"
Negative	"huge disappointment: at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
Negative	What Did I Just Read: I don't think I'm too dense. But this book was either way over my head or I just did not appreciate it. It definitely got some good reviews, and it's one of those books that schools force upon you to read. So I gave it a shot. It was an interesting idea and a short read (thank god), but I didn't like how it ended. It kind of gave me the same feeling as Children of Men and The Giver. The Giver is one of my favorite books, so I did not come into this with a prejudice. I just thought it was a really bad book. I'm glad my high school never forced me to read it.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451: We thought this book was a good one, but it started out to be slow and confusing. It is about a person name Guy Montag and he is a firefighter that burns books. He is starting to find out that it is not a good job, and he wants to quiet. This is all i can say because if I tell you any more it will give the book away. I can tell you that this is a science-fiction book, and it involves a different society. This is what makes the book so great.In conclusion, this is a good book, and even though it is hard to read in the begining, it gets much better.\Thanks for reading this.
Negative	Too bad Amazon can't help out students: I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451 Audiobook: Some Authors should NOT read their books for the audio format. This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!
Negative	"Burn it!: This book, whilst very good to begin with, fails in the end beacause Bradbury attemptes to beat his message in too late in the piece. He spends too much time describing the story, and his message, as he has rendered it, is too complex to cram into 180 pages. I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name ""clarrise"" for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo. But, other than that, i found it to be a tolerablebook, up until the death of beatty, when the novels plot development peters out, and we are left feeling cudgeled for the rest of the novel by its ""moral"" Im only 13, so nyah BURN THE BOOK! bradbury has failed miserably in creating this book."
Negative	"My thouts of the book ""Fahrenheit 451"": I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!"
Negative	NOT PLEASED: I was very disappointed when I received this book. I order it for my childs school project, the book could not be used. Most of the pages where underlined in black magic marker, which bleed through to the other sides and the book had notes written in the margins. Very displeased, I had to go to a bookstore and buy another book. Lesson well learned.
Positive	"More than just sensorship...: The lessons learned from good authors are timeless. Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new ""Amber Alerts"" adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and ""editing"" are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.""I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book."""
Positive	This is why censorship stinks!: This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book.
Negative	The book shows a bleak vision of the future of the world: The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book .
Negative	My Review: This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book.
Negative	ahhh it is alright: this book was really boring and i had to read it for a book report so instead of me reading the whole book i just rented the movie from blockbuster and watched the movie it was much easier
Negative	OK: The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
Negative	Fell short of expectations&#65533;: I heard so much about this book before I finally picked it up. And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me.
Negative	An OK book: Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous.
Negative	A major dissapointment: I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. So, I decided to read it. I was very dissapointed. Though some concepts were fairly interesting they were not developed, so book had no point. I cannot understand why this novel is as famous as it is. Do not waste your time reading Fahrenheit 451.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451, a review of: Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age.
Negative	"There Are Better Dystopias Out There: This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, ""Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?"")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."
Negative	A bit on the iffy side . . .: I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for class in eighth grade, and from the beginning, I knew this book would turn out be quite eloquent and philsosphical, but also extremely tedious. I almost fell asleep in some occasions. Bradbury does a good job describing sections in the story, but sometimes gets carried away and forgets about some mood. For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives. In conclusion, I struggled through the book and only read it out of coercion. I would never read this again.
Negative	Overrated: I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it: This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic.
Positive	Poignant and relevant still.: There isn't anything I could say that hasn't already been said in the last sixty years. It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world.
Positive	A brightly burning insight just as important today: This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?
Positive	"I HATE THE IDEA OF NO BOOKS!: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give ""Fahrenheit 451"" five big stars."
Positive	FAHRENHEIT 451: Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction.
Positive	Great!: I had to buy this book for school. At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down! I loved every description and foreshadowing, and how much of the technology was similar to today's, even though the book was written in the 1950's. I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!
Positive	The BEST book i have ever read!!: I love this book. It is exciting and thrilling. I love the idea of people not being able to read books or think for them selfes. I think that this book should be read by all.
Positive	"Relevance to our times: ""Fahrenheit 451"" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."
Positive	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to.
Positive	Feel the Heat of Words: I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy.
Positive	Couldn't Put It Down!: I have never read a book anything like this before. Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars.
Positive	emotional impact: This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you read this book in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag's pyche. This was a refreshing aspect after reading so many award winning books that seem to try too hard to force emotional impact upon the reader.
Positive	One of Bradbury's best: I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned. I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now.
Positive	"Skip the reviews; let's play the game!: Based on the reviews below, it appears that people either love or hate this book, so let's just play ""What book would you be?"" I would be ""The Great Gatsby."" Ok, your turn!"
Positive	Why do teachers force reading down our throats?: The major complaint against this book, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to read works they don't understand. I couldnt agree more. Although I am a bibliophile, and found this book very interesting, I am also consious of the unique ability of english teachers to analyse books to death. This type of novel is one that will only speak to people who would read it voluntarily anyways - many people see nothing wrong with TV. If you love books, you will love this one. If you don't you won't
Positive	Earth-Shattering: When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. But as I neared the end of the book, something struck me. This COULD be OUR future...if we didn't DO something. This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general.
Positive	Well Worth The Time: If there is one book that you read in high school that you should read again later in life, this is it. In fact, I'm inclined to think that it shouldn't be taught until at least college because there is simply no way that any child in high school can truely appreciate this amazing novel. Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always.
Positive	"captivating: As Montag's fire captain tells him, ""You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed."" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."
Positive	"Dystopian classic: Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the ""media"" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence. Sound familiar? A little too familiar. I dare say that we seem to be heading towards an age where ignorance is not merely bliss but that knowledge is loudly discouraged. I can only hope I'm wrong.A great dystopian and a much deserved classic."
Negative	Uckkk: I absolutly hated this book, It not only bored me but it aggervated me to the fullest. It wasn't realistic and the things that happen in the book were just stupid! Not to mention the main character's wife was just a moron, and who wants to burn books? I mean thats alittle odd, burning down houses because people owned books, ahhhhhhh, not a good book
Negative	I DON'T UNDERSTAND...: I AM A FRESHMEN AND I WAS REQUIRED TO READ THIS BOOK.I AM ON PAGE 29. I DON'T GET A WORD I HAVE READ. I FEEL LIKE I'M READING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. MABY IT'S BECAUSE I'M YOUNG.OR BECAUSE I'M ONLY ON PAGE 29.ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M LOST.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO REVIEWED THIS BOOK. YOU HAVE HELPED ALOT.
Negative	Painful listening: Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself.
Negative	Poor audiobook: This may be a classic story, but Ray Bradbury is not a classic reader... I couldn't get through 5 minutes of his voice. I DO look forward to reading the actual book!
Negative	Not up to par with Bradbury's other work: This is Ray Bradbury's worst book. I cannot believe ... a good writer bombs here. 1st, Clairsse McCellan, the only one who I like in the book ..., then the book skids downhill from there. 2nd, There is a lot of taking the Lord's name in vain, which is breaking a commadment and is a sin. Mr. Bradbury could do better.
Negative	The Worst book I have ever read!!!!: This book was horribly written!! It confused more than it enlightened!!! I did not enjoy it at all and I never plan to read it again.
Negative	DUMBEST BOOK EVER!!!!: You always here of classics being read by generation after generation, this isn't one of those. It should be burned itself. I can't believe i read this dumb book
Negative	Wrong book sent!: I ordered a book for my grandson's school summer reading program. The book was supposed to be Fahrenheit 451 and I received a totally different book. I returned the book and by the time another book could be sent would be too late.I probably will not order from this site again.
Positive	book, book, book: throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people. This book repersents the amount of learning that the people will be doing in the future of our county it tv will keep going as it is. the book is a good book it has the posibility of telling people what we will come to if we stop reading. There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self. Montag often feels his most revolutionary thoughts welling and circulating in his blood. thsi book kept me interested un till the end because you did not know what crazy thing was goin to go on next.
Positive	A good read: I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing.
Negative	The message is good but...: The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one.
Negative	451 review by Jessica C.: when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451- Somewhat a flop: I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars.
Positive	Alright, but sort of weird: Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book. I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother.
Positive	A novel about fireman who are paid to set books ablaze: This book was very interesting to read. This was my first time reading about the issue of censorship. I had recently wrote an essay about censorship and with the help of this book clearly made it easier for me to understand the issue better.
Positive	"Overrated. Only ""half"" as good.: I thought this book was going to be great since it is always on the teachers' lists of recommended readings. But I felt the story went a bit slow for me. The first half of the book, was not very interesting and it was a little confusing. But in the second half of the book the story really picks up. I would only recommend this book to people who like science fiction."
Negative	Fahrenheit 451: I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!
Negative	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come.
Negative	Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary.
Negative	"Fahrenheit 451 review: The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered ""dangerous"" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."
Negative	Expectations: Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works.
Positive	Sci Fi Nightmare!: Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. In this book, Bradbury creates a powerful, disturbing imagery to ilustrate his distopia, which has bone-chilling similarities with our days. A must-read, even for those who are not Sci-Fi lovers. Why didn't I five-stared? Well, I didn't like the style so much, it could be more concise. Someone said that writing is the art of eliminating words, rather than adding them.
Positive	Great book.: Let me preface this review with the statement that I was supposed to have read this book years ago, when I was still an English Major and for some reason or not I never got to it. I now understand why it is considered a must read and classic. Its a great book with such insight to our culture that I now regret greatly not reading it sooner.
Positive	Superb!: This is an amazing book. I decided to read it when I found out that Mr. Bradbury had passed away.Even though it's supposed to be fiction, it seems way too familiar, since unfortunately there are so many people who prefer wasting their lives doing unimportant things rather than spending their time reading.I highly reccomend it.
Positive	"Hurrah for Bradbury!: Art imitating life? One need only contemplate the depths of political correctness to see the coming new order. Utopian societies are hellish and brutally banal at the same time. Like Jerry Furland's terrifying novel ""Transfer - the end of the beginning"", Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" delivers a message and a vision of the future that is bleakly horrifying. You will devour both of these fine novels in a sitting. Guaranteed."
Positive	Great read!: Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!
Positive	Excellent: Reached in time for my daughter's school . My daughter enjoy it. It was for her course material so not much can be said.
Positive	What an Interesting Book!: I read this book for a book club and I really enjoyed it. It was very thought provoking, and I am sure that we will have a lot to discuss. It didn't grab me into the book, I could set it down when I needed to, but it was still really good.
Positive	Great BUT hard to follow.: This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read.
Positive	"How could you give it less than five stars?: When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was ""Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest."" Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."
Positive	Good Read: I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives.
Positive	blame xmas for lateness: Orded two books in December, and got this one just the other day (it's now the end of January). Again this was done over Christmas when the Post Offices are clogged up with post. The book is in mint condition. Thanks!
Positive	A Classic.: Ray Bradbury's 'Fahreneheit 451' is a classic that almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college. It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling.
Positive	Fahrenheit 451: Review: In this book, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the book to our eyes. 451 takes place in a distant future far from our time. In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book. I would reccomend it for anyone who is willing to give it a try.
Positive	"Farenheit 451: When I first started reading Farenheit 451, I thought this book was a little strange. But after reading more of the book, I became mezmorized by the graphic detail and colorful language.The way Ray Bradbury writes has a disturbing realism to it. He writes about the future, but his thoughts are centered around the present.Guy Montag was a fireman, not fighter. His job was to seek out books, and burn them. But his whole life changed when he met Clarisse. With three words, Guys life was turned upside down ""Are You Happy?"" Is he happy or has he been forced to be ""happy?"" Through the book, Guy sees the horrors of his life, and the lives of others. Everyone is oblivious to the torture they are experiencing. Guy wants out but society won't let him go. Guy has books, a fireman has books, books. Now society has turned its back on him, his house is burnt and he is fighting for his life. There are others like him, though, others who contain a forbidden knowledge, the knowledge of a book..."
Positive	Good Book: What can I say that has not already been said. It is a bit dark and too short, but a great effort none the less.
Negative	Read it only for school: I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book.
Negative	it was one of the worst novels i have ever read: it was very boring and i did not lik it at all. it lacked a basic plot and character development. i was very disappointed with the novel and with Bradbury.
Negative	it was okay: I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving.
Negative	The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense: This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me.
Negative	"Profoundly unfulfilling.: Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.""In the future, Firemen burn books"" -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."
Positive	Classic, for a reason: I picked this up to re-read, hadn't since high school. It is wonderful, easy to see why it has been a favorite for all these years.
Positive	Absorbing: The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. While there are some changes from the book, the film does stand on it's own.
Negative	Terrible, Terrible Book!: Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it.
Positive	Great read: I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.
Positive	THE BOOK HAD A GOOD CONCEPT BUT I COULDNT GET THE PHRASING: THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE.
Positive	impressionable: Overall, I liked this book. I am doing my 11th grade AP English-3 research paper on it. Overall, this book made me think. It made me think about how people of the WW 2 time period thought: that there might be another war. This book was an example of only one man's thoughts. It would be interesting to see what other people of this time period have to say about Fahrenheit 451.
Positive	One of the quickest classic reads around: Bradbury makes it look effortless. The story reads so fast it is as if the author wrote it in one sitting with no revisions. This book is the perfect quick read for those on-the-go folks who have little time for leisure reading. And when you are finished, you will uncover another reason the book is so short.
Negative	If you are a high school student, this would be a stunner...: If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending.
Negative	Painful to listen to: Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
Negative	Dated screed: I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.
Negative	Boring, boring, boring: I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book.
Negative	more a name then a real book: this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read.
Negative	"A bit on the dull side: Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an ""F"" grade. It squeeks two stars."
Negative	this was horrible: This book is one of the worst I have read!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to read this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple. Only one thing happens in the entire book and that one thing isn't even exciting!
Negative	"A very disturbing book: I thought this would be a interesting look at the future, and since it's heralded as a great classic, I decided to read it. I'm sorry, but this book is just DISTURBING. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. The plot was confusing, the characters were dull, and the idea is to horrid to contemplate. The ""hero"", Guy Montag, is a strange man in the beginning, and becomes a fugitive murderer later on. Unless you want to see an awful, bleak look into the future, DO NOT READ FAHRENHEIT 451!"
Negative	Awful: I read this book and i hated it. Don't waste your money on it. It will ruin any respect you have for books. Three words: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!
Negative	Burn it!: I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped.
Positive	my review: this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today
Negative	Hip Hop Uncensored, Vol. 7: Hustle On: i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos
Negative	A big joke!: This toy is ridiculous! It doesn't do anything. My boys thought you could shoot foam darts, but there is nothing to pull/push on to do that. There are no directions, and this is just a big hunk of plastic junk with a lot of screws that take you nowhere. Doesn't even make sounds.
Positive	AMAZING!: My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds, many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed. Oh they felt okay, but didn't do the trick. When I went to my brother's house, he sat me down and I sat there the entire night! It was incredible. I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist. This chair may seem expensive, but it's worth every drop. I am waiting for mine to be delivered!
Positive	Good lessons for anyone: Adolf Von Schell is a combat leader, but his lessons apply to any leadership position. This book is a short read that offers big lessons.
Negative	Remember: there's no DRANO for the brain-o (beware!): If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse movie, look no further. You've found it.One word: Feh!In NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(2.7) Night Train to Terror (1985) - Richard Moll/Cameron Mitchell/John Phillip Law/Marc Lawrence/Ferdy Mayne/Tony Giorgio/Earl Washington/Gabriel Whitehouse
Negative	What the heck?: This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase.
Negative	Mindless!: The plot is God and the Devil bet on who will win, a doctor who rapes his victims before hacking them up with a chainsaw, or a victim who is on the run who can win.
Positive	Could this really happen?: A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer.
Positive	Highly Recommended: This CD is a very impressive debut release, I strongly recommend it. Lead singer Delores O'Riordan's vocals are chilling and awe inspiring, and the band has the power and force to impress anyone. This band is also a tremendous live act, check them out!
Negative	ludwig: Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.
Negative	"Dark and dreary: A dead girl is found in a field and that leads us to several stories that kind of involve her. Each one is dark and dreary and slow. Toni Collette and Piper Laurie reinact Carrie in the first segment which adds nothing to the film. Actually only the ""Wife"" and the ""Dead Girl"" seem really worth watching and both of those are very dark and again slow and dreary. Lots of good people in this, but no real mystery or suspense. Really just kind of depressing and that's does not make for entertainment. The real world is depressing enough."
Positive	Must see: I really liked this movie. I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once. Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.
Negative	"AWFUL!: This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was depressing to watch and the story was very poorly written. All of the ""segments"" were left hanging and never actually came together at the end. There was nothing shocking about the ending, it just ended. I had to double check to be sure that was indeed the credits rolling. What a jip, I want my money back. I foolishly bought this movie without seeing it first thinking it had to be good with all the known actors and the description on the back sounded good. Boy was I wrong! I threw it in the garbage, the first movie I have ever thrown away."
Negative	Vile, all too Vile, all too stooopid: That's N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this movie.In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims. If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs! Yech!
Positive	"Disturbingly lovely..: Sometimes, a movie with a (mostly) all-star cast backfires. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. Not so with ""The Dead Girl."" It helps that each of the interwoven plot lines are presented as vignettes, each one poignant and beautiful in it's own way. It really allows the viewer time to get to know the characters. Brittany Murphy was amazing, as was Marcia Gay Harden whose portrayal of the dead girl's mother will stay with you. Great movie. [...]"
Positive	Very Simple: Spoiler Alert!They found a dead girl in the beginning of the movie. Couple of the people involved were being interviewed in the middle of the movie. They found out who the dead girl was at the end of the movie.That is basically about it. This is very simple. There are alot of sexual contents and naked women in this movie from start to finish. Even old grandma is full frontal naked from top to bottom!! make sure you cover your eyes if you don't want no nightmare. The pace is kinda slow but yet still engaging.Not a bad movie. 4 stars.
Negative	Poor Quality: Two (2) of the the selections on this disc have static & skip, in fact, the 2nd one just stops after a while. The product is virtually un-usable.
Positive	where has ramsey lewies been all my musical life?: It's rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. This CD does it. It also gets my 1 year old son shaking his nappy so strong is the rhythm. Familiar songs given a piano jazz working maybe an ignoramus' view but that's what it is. I am amazed this trio weren't hawked to me as part of a back catalogue release sooner. But this proves there are some musical gems yet to be re-released in the noughties. Ramsay, your public needs you - where are you?
Positive	Amazing CD: If you are into this type of jazz (ala, Gene Harris, Oscar Peterson ) , you gotta love this CD. It is high energy, fun, yet masterfully played. It has an eclectic mix of jazz, blues, and a little funk. There are a couple of live tracks that captures the energy of the audience...and you can imagine how amazing it must have been to see him live. This is going to go down as one of my favorite CDs next to Gene Harris's Concord Years, and Oscar Peterson's Night Train.
Positive	Finest Hour Indeed!: This is a splendid collection from a great Jazz piano master who is able to cross over into more popular forms without losing the depth and integrity of his inimitable style. Ramsey Lewis and his wonderful trio are national treasures.
Positive	"Chemists view of Materials: this book is excellently written for the chemists who are getting into materials science. the cross-over can sometimes be tough due to the ""language barrier"" in that materials typically uses different terms for subjects that chemists use. this book, being written specifically to bridge that gap, does an excellent job presenting the material for the chemists viewpoint.the theory is well laid out and examples of computational approaches and discussion of results are clearly presented. the good and bad of methods are presented in an unbiased way allowing the reader to weigh all options in order to select an approach which is appropriate for their research.i highly recommend this book for any upper level undergraduates of graduate student...or any chemist looking to cross over into the world of materials science."
Positive	Acts- Build Community: Great discussion in our community group. Confronted (mis)conceptions of the Holy Spirit. Deeper than expected from online book review - much growth for all of us.
Positive	excellent book: good product and good bible study material. learn lots about the work of the holy spirit and how it builds community
Positive	Good value: This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
Negative	low quality: the charger did work that is the only positive after one day the top broke off charger and the wires are exposed. I guess you get what you pay for..... low grade merchandise
Positive	Car charger for Motorola Razor: OEM car charger so it fits well, seems to work well too. No problems with it so far.
Negative	advertised as OEM??: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc.
Negative	Definitely a FAKE: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to. Bottom line (as always) ***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR***
Positive	Works great: The charger works great and has a nice design. The cord could be a little longer, so you could use the phone more easily while it's connected to the charger.
Positive	Razr OEM Car Charger: This product works great and looks good too. This is my second (for my wifes), I have had mine for almost 10 months with no problems.
Positive	Razer charger: works amazing in my car without any problems. Lights up a bright blue when charging and actually chargers my phone up.
Negative	"Counterfit item - but works OK: According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated ""M"". It works OK, but should not be represented as made by Motorola."
Positive	Cheap price good product: My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
Positive	Excellent Product: This Motorola product is perfect. This cigarette lighter charger is as advertised, priced very low and is everything I expected.
Negative	Won't Recharge Anything: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product.
Positive	It's Inexpensive and it Works: I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones.
Positive	Exactly what the family needed.: My family got new phones for Christmas. They all needed cigarette lighter adapters and I wasn't going to pay ALLTEL's prices for an off brand product. I got the real Motorola deal and for just a few dollars.Great product!
Positive	No worries: I have already used this item several times. It is quick and efficient. I have not had any problems. I am glad I purchased it. I'm not a technically inclined person so it is simple to use. I was pleased with the quality of the product. It was shipped very quickly and arrived at my home within a couple of days. I was impressed with this also.
Negative	Great Value for the Money: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone.
Negative	disappointed: This product did not last two months. I brought it for emergencies and when I needed it, it wasn't working.
Negative	DOA: This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for.
Negative	Motorola Razr V3, V3i, V3c, Slvr L7, L6, L2 Pebl U6, V190, Mpx200, V360, V323, V325 - Ch710 OEM Original Auto Car Charger Syn084: I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.
Positive	Gets the Job Done: Not much to say--it's an inexpensive, effective charger for your car. Particularly useful for the Razr V3m's worthless battery life.
Positive	the dharma rings twice: The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way.
Negative	Boring: As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying.
Positive	Great product: I purchased this for my truck - first class product, easy installation, great looks. It works to keep stuff off front of hood and deflects the occasional bug and rock.
Negative	Doesn't get to the meat of things: I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals.
Positive	"Wow! You gotta hear this!: This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
Negative	A somewhat annoying companion: This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in.
Negative	More About the Book: BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site.
Negative	way to make the worst game of all time: Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game...
Negative	Worst Game Ever: When i bought this game, I thought Wow! I get to play Lord of the Rings! After a week I was bored with it. THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE!!!!!!!!! The combat is very slow and tedious, and the game freezes up to much. Do not under any circumstances buy this game. I gave it one star because it is Lord of the Rings.
Negative	Horrific: ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
Negative	Don't believe any hype: First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.
Negative	Slow, buggy, and awful: I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste.
Positive	Glitches, Glitches and did I mention Glitches?: Well, the game is ok, as long as you don't want to finish it. Most of the game is just wandering around pointlessly to find things and getting lost a lot. The major problem is that at one point Gimli is invisible when you need to talk to him and the fact that every single game freezes up when you try to leave Moria. Other than that it's well.... ok for being Lord of the Rings merchandise.
Negative	Beware this game: There's a reason Gamespot gave this game a 2.1 out of 10.This game should never have gotten through Nintendo quality assurance. It's buggy -- you can't even get through Moria without the game freezing. And that doesn't mention all the problems with item cloning, invisible characters, music cutting out, and impossible quests.Even if the game was bugfree, it's awful. Combats take forever (and aren't any fun, since your characters never hit), and the best parts of the book are skipped over, like Weathertop and Amon Hen. Moving your character on screen is like steering a drunk elephant. Seriously.If you're looking for a good Lord of the Rings experience, buy the PS2 Fellowship version (skip the Xbox one), or EA's Two Towers games (either GBA or PS2).
Negative	This game really sucks: I wish I could give this game negative five stars! Whoever gives this game five stars is a complete loser who doesn't have any good games. This game is not really fun and it has major glitches in it. Why get this game when there are games like Super Mario World, Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2, or a Pokemon game! And I am not biased against Lord of the Rings games or anything like that because I enjoyed playing the Two Towers and Return of the King for the Gamecube. This game is fun for the first 15-30 minutes though. My final words are DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!
Negative	A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches: This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game.
Negative	"disappointed: I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
Negative	Might be okay, but glitches are doozies.: I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it.
Positive	exiting but...: This game is great! I could not stop playing it even when it was time for bed. I snuck played it under my covers. Only one problem. It takes forever to get through the dwarf chamber. Other than that, it is a great game and I recomend it.
Positive	Hello!: I am going to try to give you the most spectacular review u have read on this game...During this game u get 2 play as...any member of the fellowship. The cool thing about this game is that it is not divided into levels! You go on and on and on wich allows u to change players at any time! For instacnce...when the cave troll comes u do NOT wanna be pipin! not that u EVER would ,though pipin is cool, but wimpy... the strongest person u can play as is gimli...but its kinda funny watching him waddle around! The fastest person is without a doubt...Legolas! It is kinda frustrating though...how it seems in skimrishes yer pple always miss... but u can fix that by boosting up your players!Heres some info:GRAPHICS 20/20SOUND 20/20FUN 20/20BATTLE 18/20MOVEMENT 20/20OVERALL 98/100This game is sure to please any action/RPG/LOTR fan!!!
Positive	Very Anticipated!!!: The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring is a very fun and anticipated RPG video game. When I am bored I always play this great game. I can never get tired of a good GameBoy Advance fantasy RPG video game.
Negative	What a JIP!!!: This is the worst LOTR game ever!!! It takes hours to figure out the damn forest, and a lot of other crap!! My brother bought itoff ebay, and only played it once. The graphics suk, the battle is turn based and slow, and it cost us 30 friken $$!!! Don't listen to the other reviews. This game sux. Buy Return of the King and forget about dis.
Negative	Pitiful game: This game has so many bugs I'm suprised it works at all. I can't even finish because of a glitch in the Mines of Moria. I wish I could get my money back.
Positive	Hey give it some credit, listen to me.: So far this game hasn't received any credit, well not much.To start off the graphics are good, and the sound is good too.I haven't seen one glitch yet, I'm sorry. The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon. Fun game for younger kids.GRAPHICS: 8 out of 10SOUND: 6 out of 10GAMEPLAY: 7 out of 10OVERALL: 7 out of 10
Negative	"Terrible game, very disappointing: I wrote this review only to bring the average rating more in line with reality. I would definitely recommend playing this game before buying it. The story is fine and the graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so [weak]that it will bore your socks off. I used to play way too many hours of MUDs and other text-based adventure games, so I have a high tolerance for bad interface, but this game is potentially the worst I have ever seen. In fact, the game would be much better if they had replicated the character interface from ""rogue/moria"" and put it on the GBA ;)"
Negative	Please don't buy: This game does not work. All of the other reviews about the game having multiple glitches are spot on. The gameplay itself is mediocre fun, but the fun only lasts as long as the first impassable glitch. I played through thrice, and had to stop every time at a pivotal point that the programmers forgot to actually play test. Because of this one major glitch that happened every time I tried to go through, I was not even able to finish the game.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this title.
Negative	HORRIFIC: ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS NOT FUN.You'd think that they'd have music and the game does,until you make a move pretty much.Poorly designed,Buggy,You could go on and on about it's flaws. final grade F ...NOT BUY THIS GAME
Negative	Would have been nice except all the bugs!: This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money.
Positive	Horrible!: Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!
Negative	DO NOT BUY: This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Buy a good game like Golden Sun, Wario Land 4, Spyro season of ice, Crash Bandacoot, and Sonic Advance. If you buy it get it for a different gameing platform. Never buy a game after a book or movie for Gameboy Advance I bought Harry Potter for Computer and my friend bought it for Gameboy Advance and I was amazed at how much better the game was for computer. So I highly suggest that you do not buy this game for Gameboy Advance.
Negative	"Fun for Fans: As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. You can play as any part of the company of the ring, from the first book, "" Fellowship of the Ring"". The game follows the book very well, but the gameplay is a different story. In many areas you get stuck and find that the only way to get out of being stuck is by restarting the game. If you are willing to play, and play to finish the game, then you might find this a good game. The graphic are alright compared to others and you may find that it seems to have a dark tint. If you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this game, if not, i sugjest finding a different game to play"
Negative	BUGS CANNOT FINISH GAME: Do not buy this game it has bus bugs and more bugs. You cannot finish it. End of story. It gets zero stars. (0)*
Negative	burned 3 times!: I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was so excited she started playing right away. Shortly after she said there was a glitch. 2 Frodo's would suddenly appear on the screen. I took it back, and since you can only exchange the item for the same item we did. Again the glitches. During battle the players would split and you'd have 2 Frodo's or Aragorn etc.. on screen. We threw it out. Later we found several on a discount rack, Spiro's, race cars and LOTR's. So I figure what the heck, third times the charm right? WRONG. The third one had glitches also. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Especially because it wasn't an all battle game. It has action and puzzle solving too. It just should have had the glitches worked out before it was marketed.
Negative	"A Bad Video Game: Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."
Negative	Don't waste your money: This game is based on the movie but is not much like it as far as exciting goes. Don't waste your money on such a buggie game! It would be worth buying the two towers instead. The two towers for GBA starts early in the movie so you won't miss the some of the first seens in the Fellowship. My advice is NOT to buy this game!
Negative	"The Buggiest Game I've ever seen: Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
Negative	Too Many Glitches: For those of you who are considering buying this game on gameboy advance, I recommend you change your mind. The graphics are great, but several times when I was playing it, my character would freeze up or get stuck in a corner, and I had to restart the whole game. And in the Mines of Moria, when you finally find the exit, the character freezes and won't move past a certain point. It may work on other consoles, but I'm not sure because I haven't tried it yet.
Negative	Ok game: This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf.
Positive	Fun, yet challenging: This game was very fun, but it had some flaws. For instance, when in the Mines of Moria, the game will freeze at a certain point. It was very frustrating, but it is a common problem and can be worked around by going to the customer service website.The game ends suddenly when Boromir tries to take the ring from Frodo. It is very annoying having to wait for the next game before you can continue the quest!Other than that, the game is very fun & challenging. It is especially good for long car trips!
Negative	AVOID THIS GAME!!!: I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches.
Positive	"AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!: I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn't it. It's really dissappointing--the story is killed with absolutely NO drama, the music is skimpy and barely playing, and there are almsot no fights. Not that it should be a problem because it's a bare-bones system, with extreme difficulty, slow moving enemies, and confusing mechanics. To make the game even worse, you wander aimlessly through repeating areas to look for an ""item"" that helps you progress through. Although that's not a bad thing for many GBA games such as Castlevania, you'll spend pointless hours searching for an item so you could pass to the next area with the same system. It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action."
Negative	Was fun until Rivendell.: This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy.
Positive	There's no glitches!: I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point. You wouldn't want to by a thirty dollar game that lasted two hours. That would [bad]!
Negative	"Sorry, try again: This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot! If you're looking for a start-to-finish process of how to side a house, as I was, this is NOT it."
Negative	Not very helpful: I was hoping to find detailed instructions for selecting vinyl siding and installing accessories like soffits, trim, adding insulation, etc. I already know the basics of hanging vinyl siding. I found a lot of the instructions and many of the diagrams confusing. I found the FREE planning guides and installation instructions from the siding manufacturers more helpful. At $14.95 it is not worth the money.
Negative	"Wrong Title: This book should be titled ""How to Bend Aluminum"". It is poorly written and even worse when it comes to the useless illustrations. It has no business being advertised as a vinyl siding book, and if you should buy it, I'm sure you will find it a waste of your money as did I."
Positive	A sorely underrated gem of a platformer for Gamecube: Vexx is the type of game that you can not fully appreciate until you get into some of the later levels. I for one think this games' graphics are great, especially through progressive scan. Awesome character designs and very unique textures. Where this game really shines are the awesome, huge worlds you traverse through. I found myself not being able to wait to see what new world i was going to unlock. Each level has 8-10 goals that you can tackle in any order, making it an extremely non-linear game. One area that this game really shines in is the PUZZLE DESIGN! Some of the puzzles in these levels are INGENIOUS! This game is truly for hardcore platforming fans only, if you can't handle your analog stick to perform precise jumping, crawling or maneuvering, you need to stick to your first person shooters.
Positive	Vexx Rules: I read alot on this game and think it sounds great. I will be buying this if I get good grades on my report card.
Positive	TONS OF FUN!!!: I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THOSE THAT RATE TOP NOTCH GAMES WITH ONE OR TWO STARS AS SOME HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE=THE GRAPHICS IN THIS GAME IS WORTH THE COST OF THE GAME ALONE=IT IS CLEVER AND TOUGH TO GET TO THE HEARTS AND IF YOU GET BORED PLAYING THIS GAME YOU NEED TO GO GET A LIFE=THIS IS A BREATH-TAKING GAME AND VERY VERY CLEVERLY DONE=TONS OF RE-PLAY VALUE!!!
Positive	This game trashes other games: OK people, you may think this game sucks, but it doesnt, i have made a lot of research on it and i cant wait till it comes out.It is raw, the levels are so cool theyr huge, the controller is easy to use and this game is an absolute must-have.
Negative	If you've played mario on N64, you're played this: Basically, if you ever played mario on the N64, you know what this game is going to be like. It's the same type of scenario where you do various things in each level to achieve stars (or hearts in the case of this game). The graphics are cool, but I just became bored due to the dejavue factor. I was dissapointed.
Negative	I'M OVER IT: With.. Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox, Zelda, & Wario World who's going to have time for this? Please ~Acclaim~ no sequels. Truthfully the first level was so boring I didn't care to go further. I know it reeks that you may have payed ~x~ amount of $'s for this game , but don't beat yourself up. Just brush it off and buy one of the other games I mentioned above. I can only give a few nods for good graphics, sound and idea. Hence the 2 stars.
Positive	Great overview for those interested in the event industry: I have worked in the event industry for the last three years and decided to read through this book prior to getting into the industry. After gaining more experience and being apart of both small and large events I can honestly say that this book has a ton of applicable information. I highly recommend this book if you plan on entering the event industry, putting on your own event, or just would like to see how much time, effort, and planning goes into events.
Positive	Expensive, but a great headset...: I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great. I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life.Too bad it's not possible to pickup/hangup without connecting a headset lifter (lame).
Positive	great quality: For the money this is the best quality sound and options. You can have 5-10 people all in the same office using at the same time with no feedback or echoing.
Negative	Disappointing: At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300.
Positive	new headset: the quality of this is very good. only problem is that i wish the battery would last longer. lasts about 4 hours
Positive	Who says Old Folks don't have fun: I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday
Positive	"Dear Mad'm: This book is a beautiful biographical story by the person who lived it. The story is wonderfully entertaining from beginning to end. It makes you want more from her continuing to live in the Cal. mountains as an elderly woman with ""young legs"".David Brokaw"
Positive	Dear Mad'm: I first purchased this book while on a vacation trip exactly 14 years ago (1989); since then I've tried to read it at least once a year. I laugh my way through the book, and the author's courage & zest for life continues to inspire me! I only hope I am able to always view life with the same gusto & joy she had, trials & tribulations notwithstanding. She was quite a remarkable woman.
Negative	"Book is better than the movie: I really liked the book, that is why I got this DVD. Big mistake. The acting is so bad, it reminds me of those cheesy after school specials where it seems like they just pulled people off the streets and said ""here's the script, do the best you can"". I have several of Mary Higgins Clark's DVDs. It is pretty much hit and miss as to whether or not the acting will be good or not. You're better off renting them."
Positive	"They Wrote the Book on Transistor Radios: One of the ""must haves"" if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. Hundreds, (thousands?) of listings with photos of some, descriptions of all, and date of manufacture for most. The book also contains estimated value ranges, and useful introductory information."
Negative	"BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!: What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity."
Positive	Great for a trip: I bought this movie to my 6 years old daughter see when we are on a trip. But she like so much that everywhere we go she take with her. It's a great movie.
Negative	The Adoption theme is problematic: Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life.
Positive	Cheap, and perfect: Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem).
Negative	Not what was pictured: Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
Negative	Yellow on Yellow (no black lettering at all): Terribly misleading picture. The Black writing on yellow plastic is exactly what I was looking for, and it is exactly the way most Swanson tools are made. NOT THIS ONE. This is all yellow without a hint of a shadow for contrast. You can still use it for square cuts and such, but don't count on reading the numbers. Get the metal version that is all grey - they are easier to read even with their lack of contrast.I plan to keep the one I ordered and spray paint it black and then quickly wipe the paint off of the flat surfaces in the hopes of getting something like what is pictured. Shame on Amazon for using this picture.
Negative	Not standard size: This tool does not fit into my American made nail bags.The plastic seems really strong but i will never know cause i cant carry it.
Positive	"Can't go wrong with Corcoran!: Well made, great tread for walking in snow, sand and standing to work in all day long, I bought these for my partner and he stands at his job all day long and will only wear combat boots. His last pair of combat books were jump boots and the sole did not last. As a former military wife I would never buy anything but a Corcoran boot. The field work boot looks like it will be up to the wear and tear he puts on his footwear plus the soul is thick and has a great tread. We received them in record time to ""boot!"" THANKS! You cannot CANNOT GO WRONG with Corcoran's no matter what cut or style!"
Negative	Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!
Negative	Tatum's Worst Hour: The pops and hiss are a horrible distraction. Sounds like a cheap tape recording of a really scratched up record. Buy any other Tatum CD and you'll be much happier.
Positive	Great work, but...: Art Tatum's playing on this album is truly amazing. It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius. However, the sound quality really turned me off when I was first listening to the record. Its hard to not notice the fuzz, and if I feel that the record deserves a 4.5, nothing lower, which is why I rated it a 5.
Positive	"Baby oh babys good for my baby!: OK,listen up people! My daughter Lauren bought me this book for mothers day because of its cartoonish cover. But we all know the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" My daughter read it before me (let me mention shes ten and very mature)and liked it but when I read it we both agreed that it sort of overdid the sexual content, but is a good book none the less. It was funny, sad,outragious, and over all a sweet and amusing book. Mostly for adults but mature pre-teens can read it too! Wonderfulfor adults and kids who understand love and the situations in this book. And might I add that Lauren could not put it down for five seconds even if she tried! Same thing with me!Go buy it unless your BORING..."
Negative	Started out fine, but petered out...: Too much time spent on secondary characters or too much time spent apart by the main characters made this very slow reading for me. I really liked Jake to begin with but I eventually came to not really care. The initial conflict was very strong, but then the author seemed to drift off and care more on Jake's in-law's relationship. The final conflict was resolved too easily for me to really buy into it.But it's not all bad. Ms. Wells writing voice is smooth and easy. I'd be interested to see what she comes up with in the future.
Positive	Lighthearted and Witty!: Robin does a superb job of bringing an unusual twist to an everyday setting. My mother and I rarely agree on books but this one had us both laughing. I was especially fond of the twinkies, and how the baby mysteriously kept gaining weight. And of course, this review wouldn't be complete if I didn't note my appreciation for the 'pick a peck of poop' sign.Two Thumbs Up!
Positive	Good, easy read...: This was a cute story, although not too original. Easy read. I would read this author again.Classic feel good love story.
Negative	"Bad Selection!!!!: Why dont the people who chose songs for Mangione's compilations, instead of just keep putting the same old songs on compilation after compilation, pick some new ones. Perhaps the only reason to buy this album is for ""Floating,"" as it is the only song not yet used for a Chuck Mangione compilation."
Positive	Worth the Indulgence: The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is the hefty price. This briefcase is terrific and just the ticket for a baseball loving guy who traded in his glove (but not his love for the game) for a desk. It's heirloom quality and I may well come back in 20 years to give it a full five stars if it ages as well as I expect.
Negative	Nice briefcase, horrible customer service: I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. I contacted the company that shipped the bag, something like 'Sports Accessories', not Rawlings. After 3 months of poor communication (and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle) they informed me that their service department was closing. I asked them to return the broken buckle, but no response. The story is longer than this, but as a result of horrible customer service, I now have a briefcase that i cannot use.
Positive	Doesn't degrade sound quality: I bought this and a RiteAV 25 ft. 3.5mm Extension Cable at the same time. The RiteAV 25 ft. 3.5mm Extension Cable dramatically compromised the sound quality into my B&W P5 headphones. This headphone extension cable, by contrast, did not cause any drastic deterioration in sound quality. Because of the solenoidal supercoiling, full extension to 25' is difficult, but if you are within say 15' to 20' of your amp, this should not be problematic.
Positive	great but........: great water housing. but where is the lens cap? i spent $200 on this housing at a store and i am so paranoid about scratching the lens its rediculous.
Positive	Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers: Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers. It would be helpful, if you want to learn 'matlab' as a mechanical engineer.
Positive	"Songs 4 Life is 4 kids!!: My kids (kindergarten & first grade) love the Songs 4 Life kids ""Light your World."" The songs are easy to sing along with and the know many of the songs. I found the tempo a little repetitive but I was impressed with the kids' ability to sing along."
Positive	Great CD but hard to read: My son and I both love the CD and the variations between Japanese songs, bilingual songs that we knew prior, and conversations in Japanese. The book is a bit difficult to read because of the small print of the Japanese kanas, Romanji, and the English Translations in the back. This would be easily remedied with slightly larger print. It is still a great purchase.
Negative	"Need to know some Japanese before using this product: I found the product inadequate. This CD is a collection of children's songs, with some narrative, spoken by a child in Japanese, preceding each song. The weird thing is the narrative is completely unrelated to the song. Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words ""completely random"".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to ""learn"" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised."
Positive	asking for an information: Hi ,We are running a pub here iN Marmaris Turkey.Since long time we are looking for the production place on lite ice cubes to import here to Turkey to sale.If you would like to make business with us to sale this product here in Turkey to the clubs please ,inform us about the details...If you do not prefer to make business together would you help us where to find the production center of this product in china or in Europe...Thank youSincerelYBar SoydanZulal UyAnik
Positive	"What a blast!: These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded, next to your bed in case the power goes out, toss them in the pool, the tub, the punchbowl,the fun ideas with these things are endless. Incidentally, these work just the same as all the other ""Waterless"" drink coolers that we've had since long before the ""lighted"" ones arrived on the scene. Why-ever would you ""throw them out"" just because the light was done??"
Positive	"Theme gifts: I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a ""darkened environment."" Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use. Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them. Batteries are not replaceable (unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes). Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery's decay."
Negative	HORRIBLE!: I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars. I turned all of them on at 10:10p.m. At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and wouldn't turn back on. They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube. They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these. They were cool until they went out.
Positive	Useful litecubes for different events: I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. (It is such a great gift in festival's sovenuior such as wedding, X'mas or Halloween.) Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests, especially in darkness environment. If you want to buy Litecubes, you can contact us as follow email address: icubesworkshop@yahoo.com.hk
Positive	"Great Argument: This book is a great example of rational thinking. The way Paley states his argument is flawless, and he uses all the resources available by his time. His arguments, of course, are no longer useful to creationists, this book was written way before Darwin and Wallace structure their theory, but at his time this was a must read. Even Darwin and Wallace read the book lots of years later, when they were students, and this book imprint (at least as I'm concern) a great prejudice Darwin had to surpass to establish his theory. It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book ""The blind Watchmaker"" that was inspired by Paley's ""Natural Theology"", and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so). This is a classic book, it is incredibly interesting from a lot of different perspectives, I highly recommend it."
Positive	"Under rated: Damon Knight was a genius who was largely unapreciated.""Rule golden"" is amazing.As was ""A' is fir anything.Can not praise his brillance enough."
Positive	Awesome book: I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the development of women in Islam in Africa. The book portrays anthropological and feminist insights to construct a critical ethnography. Furthermore, it explores the difficulties that women in developing countries must face on a daily basis. Other than this, I received the book within of week of my purchase and the book was in excellent condition; I would recomment this seller to anyone.
Positive	you can't beat Swanson for quality :o): Quality is always first with Swanson, they are perfectly square when you test them. Lightweight enough to be easy to handle, but strong enough to not bend like the cheap ones. Best price and instant ship.
Negative	Too long to read!: The section on humor is very good, but if you want to improve your presentation skills, it's no point reading a big book, you have to practice to improve.This book could have been more useful if it were more concise.
Positive	Eight for the Money: If you are a fan of public television, you are going to love this combo! Every title was entertaining, without all the rude sex and violence found in so many of today's box office blockbusters. Delightful and humorous features for only pennies, in your own living room.
Positive	I Love British Films and The Classics: Why?Because of Colin Firth and Maggie Smith and Judy DenchAlso My daughter in Germany only has her Video Library for entertainment so I send them to her
Positive	Some great movies: Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these movies. Thought maybe they would be sub pr because there were so many for such a great price. Actually some real gems and some great actors.
Positive	Britfest!: Great movies, Lots of fun and entertainment with this DVD. It was at our door right after I ordered it. Delivered in very good packaging not a scratch on it. How nice to have so many movies in just two discs. Years of enjoyment ahead with this purchase. I recommend this collection, highly.Indy Jan
Negative	"Disappointed: What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"
Negative	Love british movies: But I had already seen some of this movie on Netflix, and did not realize until I had purchased this movie
Positive	Love this collection: If you enjoy all things English, not to mention Colin Firth, you will love this DVD. Not to mention the other great stories, not headlined by Mr. Firth.
Negative	The picture quality was AWFUL!!!: Being a collector of period pieces, I have never watched a collection with such aweful picture quality. Do not buy this collection if you want mediocre or good quality viewing.
Positive	British Cinema Collection: 8 Acclaimed Films: I couldn't believe 8 movied for less than I usually pay for one. Someof my favorite actors wer in these & I thoroughly enjoyed the films.
Positive	Excellent collection.: I loved all eight films on this DVD. All of the stories were great and the actors did a wonderful job.
Negative	British Film Collection: We've watched three of the eight and find them hard going. I thought they would be historical but have found the plots to be mundane and predictable. Maybe the others will be better.
Negative	disapointed: have not seen them all but several so far are trash and the others so-so. would not see them again or recommend them to anyone.
Negative	No captioning: I was surprised to find that none of the films have English Subtitles or closed captioning, even though when I look at single DVD's of the individual movies, they do have closed captioning. Useless to me.
Negative	Inconsistent and not Family Friendly: Be aware that while the best known of these is sweet PG rated film and one is listed as Dove approved, others are PG-13 & R rated and filled with nudity and crudity. A disappointment.
Positive	8-Movie British Classic Files: This was an amazing collection of British films. They were all very well acted and played out. I prefer British film over Hollywood because the actors in British cinema are REAL people. There isn't all that Hollywood glamour!.All in all well played.
Negative	Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV: Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!
Negative	DON'T GET THIS!: OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it.
Negative	Be aware of ATI products: I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI.
Negative	This Card is fair - service is really bad: Used the card for about 4 weeks and had problems with audio which traced to the bad (...) connector on back..efforts to get service have failed ...This card and its associated software should have been more extensively tested by ATI.
Negative	"Bad product. Horrible drivers: I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the ""DV"" output of the card had something to do with my problems)."
Positive	"Fantastic shoes: I think these are possibly the best shoes I own! I don't know how people have such a problem with them. The leather is soft and doesn't rub anywhere at all. I'm so picky about shoes and have no tolerance for ""breaking them in"". These required none of that. I'm on my feet for 7 to 8 hours a day, every day, and wear these almost constantly. Yea, they're not big on arch support, but they're ballet flats, which never have arch support. Relatively speaking, these are pretty good in that department. Cute with pants, jeans, or casual skirts. Perfect shoes - at any price!"
Negative	Ballet Flat: For it being a Clark Shoe, it had NO arch support. I returned item but had to pay the shipping.
Negative	Cute but OUCH!: I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability, but I was so disappointed with these! I wore them around the house for a couple of days, hoping I'd be able to break them in, but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet (where the little strap crosses over) was rubbed off and bleeding. I decided to return them. I'll buy Clarks shoes again, but these were not good!
Negative	Cute but painful: Ugh. I was so excited to get these shoes, but they kill my feet! The band across the top is too tight, and the heels are too loose and rigid. Thre is a definite sizing problem. After one day of wearing them I had raw skin on the top of my foot and my ankles. So painful I went out and bought a different brand of shoes to replace them the next day. Super disappointing!
Negative	Author Succeeds in Making Erotica Boring.: I'm sure the 'Did you find this review helpful?' patrol will vote me off the island, but this is absolutely the WORST collection of erotica I've ever read... and I've read (er um) lots.Look elsewhere... this one's a snooze.
Positive	"Behold, one of the original masters!: If one were ahead of the pack and twenty years later the pack had caught up and stomped all over one's then newly demarked turf, is one to blame and to be scorned as cliched by ""today's standards""? Certainly not.The problem is, sometimes it happens. Hassell, Riley, Reich et al are usually in this situation. Now that their studies of non-Western music have been exploited and rampantly overused by anyone from hip-hoppers to electronica artist as well as avant-garders, their legacy is muddled by nay-sayers and not very knowledgeable folks. A shame indeed.Hence, the music of Hassel in Power Spot and Fourth World Music is what the latter day acolytes should be measured against, not viceversa.That said, the music itself is a thrill to experience for the first time (and well beyond). Its use of microtonics, polyrhythms, etc puts to shame many a contemporary ripper-off, setting a standard that still has to be upped. Pure class!"
Positive	"Today's Standards, Today's Schmanders: Timeless, sublime, beautiful, otherworldly. Forget most of today's derivitive, mixing hip hop, copy cat, [stuff]. This is the real thing. Hassell was there on Terry Riley's original ""In C"" recording that changed music for all time. He's the first trumpeter with a new sound since Miles. He's deep into it, micro rhythms, polyphony, microtones, electronics everything. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE HIM. And this is arguably one of the best. Those who think Eno and his ilk invented alternative music should do a little more research, and find out who the real progenitors are."
Positive	Death To The Posers: If you like death metal, then this is the C.D and band for you. They currently have 2 c.d's out and if your lucky you can find the original demo tapes floating around. This isn't some cheesy little European death metal band, people of the underground are tuning in to what may soon become the next Dimmu Borgir.
Negative	SQUEKY SPRINGS: In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
Positive	From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted: Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel books exist for the country? Because it's quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. In Living Abroad In France, author Terry Link begins with the dream and offers a step-by-step progression to achieving its reality, with chapters surveying all aspects of living in France. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted.
Positive	Not used yet: These are spares for the wristrocket I bought my daughter so the have not been tested but they seam fine.
Positive	Progressive in more recent years: Nice Euro mix for a united states tour. For progressive fans this is a must have for the collection.Wish I was there........not sure if the once a year concert is still happening.
Negative	backpack: Great looking bag. The compartments are the best I have had in a back pack. The support structure is poorly designed which leads to pressure spots on the shoulders and early failure of the seams. Baby it a little (avoid using just one strap with more than a lite load) and it should do ok for the price.
Negative	Laptop May Fall Out: I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore.
Positive	"The way singles should be...: All four of the b-sides on this album could've appeared on ""The Man Who."" I actually like a couple of them more than the single ""Writing to Reach You.""""Green Behind the Ears"" is a good pulsating rocker that also makes a good singalong song. ""Only Molly Knows"" (which wasn't a hidden track on my copy of ""The Man Who"") is a brillant acoustic endeavor that follows a unique song structure of repeating the name ""Molly"" twice in each verse. ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"" sounds like a Beatles outtake, with Fran taking on the role of a ""Helter Skelter""-esque Paul McCartney. Another great track. The last track, ""High as a Kite,"" is also exceptional in its call-and-response chorus.Believe me, even if you just own ""The Man Who,"" if you ever come across this single, get it! A great single and four excellent b-sides! What more could you ask for?"
Negative	50 shut up: ever since game left 50 or curtis has had one flop after another 50 scooped up thgis wack rapper from cali to ereplace game and bragged vthat this fool would go platinum just because he's on g unit well this wack cd flopped like everytrhing 50 droped in the last year.
Negative	Does not work with Windows XP: The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up. Simpletech's web site and tech support are a joke! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages. Save your money.
Negative	A poor implementation of Plug N' Play: This device should configure a lot easier than it does. I'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware. I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website. Once you get the correct version of the drivers, and install it following the instructions EXACTLY (the device cannot be plugged in while loading the software) it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device. 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002. The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does. I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more, and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types.
Positive	It is a reader/writer: I had two computers, windows 2000 and windows XP. Windows XP recognized the device immediately, but windows 2000 took me 3 hours to download SP3 to upgrade my system( follow the instruction on the manual). It works on windows 2000, too.The best thing about this product is that it is also a writer. You can use it as an USB drive with your CF/SM card in. I use it to transfer large files between my two computers, instead of a floppy or USB pen drive( which I planned to buy, but not any more).BTW, its speed is USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. Though it is fast enough, it is better if it is USB2.0.
Negative	Works sometimes: From what I understand of these types of hardware, they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors (e.g. Simpletech) who combine them into the nice products we buy for distribution.Unfortunately SimpleTech doesn't quite get things right. The driver installation for this product went smoothly on Windows XP. It was a matter of clicking the mouse a few times, a reboot, and plugging in the device into a USB slot.However, what followed afterwards and for succeeding attempts at getting the thing to be recognized by your PC would be what I call my own form of digital gambling. Some days the device works when I plug it in, and some days it doesn't. The odds are usually not in my favor.I would have much preferred a more expensive item that worked all the time.
Negative	Not worth it: This card reader isn't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it.
Negative	"Snake Oil: The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
Negative	Beware of bogus reviews...: Like some of them for this piece of [junk]. It's fabulous. It solved all of my problems. Next thing you know these fools will be trying to convince you that it'll eliminate world hunger. I bought one of these and used it maybe 5 times in about 2 months with my smartmedia card. After that it just stopped working. I know it was connected correctly because the drives continued to map to it, but when I inserted either card and tried to access the data on it I was given a message to insert a card. Avoid this product
Positive	Preformance without PRICE!!!: This is the 2nd flash card reader I have purchased. My operating system is Windows 98se, As you may have read in many areas the problems with USB compatibility.. I had a previous product that left me frustrated BIG TIME!! This is SO PAINLESS. You plug it in and follow the SIMPLE directions. I had this compact flash card reader set up and running with in minutes!!!I have used it for business daily and personal use also. IT IS A GODSEND. I have had ZERO PROBLEMS with this item. And a bonus is it will also read Smart Cards.I was surprised at the affordable price, ease of set up and in this day of HIGH TECH compatability issuse and patches I CAN SAY IT WORKS WELL AND WORTH THE LOW PRICE!!!Happy Pic taking.A Blond
Negative	Window XP ?????: I Instaled this at home, and it's not compatible with windows XP, it crash my windows system, and in the support page from simple tech there is not a good solution for this problem.
Positive	Great product!: I have an older digital camera that takes a compactflash card, but the new one I want to get uses smartmedia. What to do? No problem, I got the new camera and this Flashlink reader so I can use both cards and both cameras!
Negative	"Bad acting 101: It's all been done before but with talented actors. This movie should only be shown in acting school : ""Bad acting 101"". Totaly unconvincing perfomances all around especially by Emily Hampshire, could that mean bad directing? Don't waste time or money."
Positive	Rocket Power Beach Bandits: Best game ever buy it fun caracter switch select button item select R button Password mondo mountain XGVXHQWS. If you want to win consantraitI have 10 passwords the mondo mountain password is above.The best game ever $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it now worth the $$$$$$$$$$$$ buy it when you can!!!
Negative	This game SUCKS!: I bought this game and it really sucks! The reason that I bought this game was because I like Rocket Power a lot, and I thought it would be cool to have this game. Once I played it I got bored and wanted to sell it. It doesnt save at all. You have to write passwords down!If you are planning to have this game, you shouldnt! Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played.
Positive	Heartfelt: Pam, one of the Pony Pals, is shocked to discover that Lightning, her pony, is behaving oddly. He seems upset with her, her friends, and even the other ponies. Pam soon learns the problem is more serious than Lightning's hurt feelings. Readers will be just as anxious as Pam for a happy resolution.This is the first Pony Pals book I have read, and I found it very enjoyable. While its relatively straightforward plot and writing style are clearly aimed at younger readers (well, younger than me, anyway), I still got caught up in the emotion. I was also impressed at the level of complexity shown in the friendship between the Pony Pals. Yes, they're all friends, but that doesn't mean everything is always sweetness and light. I'm surprised to find myself wanting to read other books in the series, and I'm sure regular readers will be pleased by this installment.
Positive	Pretty Good: In this book, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn't know why. Soon, Lightning starts getting more dangerous and gives Pam a couple more bruises. That's when it's decided to get Pam's dad involved, but what's wrong with Pam's Pony? I liked that at the beginning for once that I didn't have a clue what the problem was. Even though I am getting a little old for this series, I like the fact that these books are well written and deserved to be read.
Positive	Great Read!: Pam has NO idea what is making Lighting act very strangly. She gets bucked out of the saddle,refuses to eat, and doesn't listen. Will Pam have to give up her pony, or is some seriously wrong with Lighting?? Read to find out!! I LOVE this book VERY,VERY much!!!
Positive	good !: Didn't realize what games I would be getting with Namco other than ms.pac man, I was hoping there would be mappy lol but game came as expected.
Positive	WOW!!!: Maybe the best $20 i've spent in my life. I love retro arcade games, and game i found sitting in the kohl's department store and i immediatley bought it. The graphics are low (duh) but it is still great. There are so many good games; my favorite is Galaga Arrangement, a new version of Galaga with better graphics and more power-ups. BUY IT!!!
Positive	The video games we used to play as kids....: My 9 year old son received a GameCube for Christmas and the 2 games he received were WaveRunner and Luigi's Mansion. Both of those games he liked, however I have motion sickness bad and cannot play alot of the games they have out now because of all the movement. I specifically bought this Namco Museum for me and guess what everybody loves it! It is great to be able to show my son some of the older games we used to play as kids. I just wish it had Centipede on it..That would be great. Enjoy all you Pacman and Galaga fans....
Negative	12 games for 9 bucks: Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong
Negative	This reference book is terrible!: I wish I had bought the Roget's International version. There are so few synonyms in this thesaurus--and if I want definitions, I'll use the dictionary. Synonyms: worthless, useless, stink-o
Negative	"I don't know about this edition, but 1st was crap. Try...: Buy ""The Synonym Finder"" if you want a REALLY good thesaurus. I am only familiar with the first edition of ""Roget's II,"" but I consider that edition to be among the worst volumes in print."
Negative	Terrible choices; Not thorough enough.: I do NOT recommend this reference book. It has very little synonyms and merely takes up shelf space.
Negative	"Do you have no family or job?: There may be rewards here for people who are intelligent enough and have the time to spend, but that's not me. I've always felt ""smart."" (800, 800 and 730 on the GRE's-degrees in mathematics) but this book made me feel like a mental midget. Either Joyce had an I.Q. of about 775 or there is nothing here to understand. I don't have time to find out. At least we got the word, ""quark,"" from this book."
Positive	try: get some help and give it a chance. skeleton's key is good and if you can get the tapes then you're half way there.
Negative	Will be forgotten: FW will soon be forgotten because soon (a century?) no one will be able to understand it. As it is, only a few thousand people in the entire world bother with it now because it is too difficult and arduous to read. Reading FW is more like a language project than a pleasant reading experience. Some people like to work out mathematical theorems. Some may like working out FW. I do not. With each year, because of the way language changes, FW will become more and more incomprehensible so that there will eventually be more people around who read and understand Old Norse than this novel. Joyce, who loved languages, should have known that. As it is, he wrote a novel with its own built in destruction. He consigned it to what is a certain and inevitably obscure death.
Negative	"Finnegans Wake Me Up: One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they've read the book cover to cover but actually haven't read more than a little; or (2) if they have read it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands.One thing it is not (contrary to what some pretentious reviewers here would have you believe) is a ""fun read"" or ""page turner"".Despite some glittering word play and demonstrations of great scholarship, Finnegan's wake is a hulking mess."
Positive	Finnegans Wake: Not Just a Book, and Experience: I'm 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best book I've ever read. I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine. GET THIS BOOK NOW!
Negative	"James' Joys is Dead!: With this lit tall reave view I rue in all love Joyce is ""Fink Against Wake."" Poor Read errs, why do use still read that mess?! Be cause it is litterassure! Aye con cur! Joyce sad little skill lend less art. I ownly at hack him be cause tomb many read errs prays him. He is dead end gone. I am all I've! Your hear owes dead! Go back kenned lessen to what he rote. Then calm back hear end read this say gain. Come pair. There is no con test."
Negative	"Gibberish!: ""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."
Negative	Ridiculously Bad: I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about.
Positive	Greatest book ever written: Unbelievably complex book; possibly the last book you ever have to read & understand. Take 3 years to work on this masterpiece. A good grasp of Celtic and British history essential to its full appreciation. The story of creation, the theory of cultural evolution of civilization, the history & mythology of the Celtic people...what more could you possibly want?
Negative	Please email me tell me why this is not drivel: My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake.For years, I have asked English Lit experts what is the genius of Finnegans Wake. No one could give me a straightThe Emperor has no clothes. No one knows why this is great, save for some so called experts who extol this book.I beg of anyone out there, please email me tell me why this is not drivel. You can reach me at alkruse@gmail.com
Negative	If you are one of the 7 people who understand this book, please let me know: If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating.
Negative	Who's Laughing?: This is an ongoing hoax perpetrated, sustained and constantly embellished by a Literary Establishment who simply wish to award each other doctoral degrees in pretending to understand this mishmash of a book. It may very well be the worst thing ever published. It is certainly the worst thing ever published with college courses based around it.
Negative	An Udder Disaster: The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience.
Negative	Huh?: Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the book for people who didn't find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Don't even bother trying to read this.
Negative	Finnegan's Wake: Stream-of-conscious blather that only a psuedo-intellectual could appreciate. I can't imagine being the person who had to proof-read this drivel, I would sooner plunge my hand into a vat of boiling oil. If it were possible I would give this book zero stars. You'd be better off spending your money on some LSD and interpreting the meaning of the waves in your fingerprints.
Positive	"Laughter: What helped me understand this monument of literature a bit better was the anecdote I read in Nora Joyce's biography ""Nora"", where she complained that she couldn't sleep at nights when Joyce was writing FW in his working room, laughing at his own scribings.Finnegans Wake is one of the most hilarious/beautiful books I've read. In fact I could replace the ""hilarious/beautiful"" with just about any other adjective, and it would explain as much."
Positive	"Cross-world: O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
Negative	NOOOOOO: NO! BOOK BAD BOOK BAD BIG BIG WORDS I DONT UNDERSTAND! MY BRAIN HURTSSSS! THIS MAKE NO SENCE. YAHOO CHAT MUCH EAZYIER TO UNDeRSTAND! I GO THERE NOW.
Positive	overjoyced!: What a zen master would state in a 3-line Haiku poem, Joyce says in a 700-page book, with ever dancing, ever-changing words in an amazing, multi-levelled labyrinth, more suitable and charming to Western intellect than Oriental thought. Definitely NOT the first Joyce book to read. Life is a wake, live it or krikkit!
Negative	Exactly what's wrong with Literary Scholars: This book is long. Long and pointless. Sure, it's fun to sit down and make up words, or compose stream-of-consciousness relayings of dreams we've had, but why would anyone want to read them?And, anyway, any book with a quote on the back from Harold Bloom is not worth MY time, at the very least. That man is a menace, and so is James Joyce. Thinkers thinking about thinking. Not real people, not real thoughts, no significance, no soul. Pointless, long, and forgettable.
Negative	Whoa, dude!: My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!
Negative	word salad as verbal Rorschach test: let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate.
Negative	this is bad: This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world. This book has no value except to make you laugh at how far some people would go to pretend that it could be interpreted. There are better wastes of ones time, for example staring at a blank wall.
Negative	One of the most unreadable books ever!: Which should be the only reason one would have this book in a collection.Daferring on red hair moots the ramdelgerag! Cays hast ner eyed the entire lash from the libre, does get sidlelassinlunahack? And for ery' scholar of jits and wallyfins, dare may cieved a consciousable readament of peering quenth Labrynth. Hark! Vain! Rack! Finnegans Wake dost injoyafun for the kathweolasopkookoo. One glance may planner read and ner open this Rhodical magnumus.If you understood what I just wrote then you may just enjoy this book.
Negative	"WTF is this?!: Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
Negative	Contemptious: The pretence here is to say that if you don't think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Its the same stunt as pulled by 'modern-art', whose lack of popularity and understanding among most people lends it a perverse exclusivity among irrational psuedo-intellectuals.No one 'understands' this book because there is nothing in it. Its not hard-going because it is so mentally challenging, its hard going because it is so uttlerly uninspiring. A dime pulp romance novel tells us more than this book can.If someone crafted your house with the same 'wondrous perception' as Joyce crafted this book, it would be rubble sunk in cement dust.
Positive	Iteration: FW is not a piece of literature. It is beyond literature: It approaches life and non-life. Is life easily analyzed and coherent? Is non-life? Joyce recognized the dichotomy and tried to capture the incapturable in words. He taunts the reader with meaning and the critic with nonsense. Ultimately, both the divergencies converge and vice versa. Take a look at the Mandelbrot fractal: Numbers approach nil and infinity giving alluring patterns in a mimicry of life and non-life. Joyce creates the already-created, concurrently destroying the already-destroyed.A long the...Joyce presents the question - forbidden fruitriverrun,Joyce slithers toward us - temptationpast Eve and Adam'sJoyce plunges the reader into chaos - banishmentWe find ourselves ensnared in a recirculation, striving once again for order, until we realize that we must step back in order to find Truth.I haven't even read the book, but does it really matter???
Negative	Evelyn Waugh: Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page. That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from.
Negative	"Don't bother: Imagine John Lennon's nonsense lyrics for ""I am a walrus"" going on for hundreds of pages. I think maybe a hundred or so people in the entire world might enjoy digging through this but the rest of us can put this one aside. Don't fall for that snobby ""Well, it's not for lazy or stupid people"" nonsense. This is nothing more than a self absorbed word puzzle for those who do not have lives to live but have plenty of time to waste deciphering this. Maybe, one day, if I am ever in a crippling accident and am confined to a wheelchair with little to do but figure this one out, I might attempt reading through it again. Everyone else, stay away!!"
Negative	"I'm Baffled: I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's ""genius"" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."
Positive	In Defense: this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us.
Negative	"Understanding ""Switters"": In Tom Robbins ""Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates"" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages. I now understand why."
Negative	"The Story of Humanity?: The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity? How is my understanding of, or sympathy toward, humanity improved by attempting to read and decode the word ""Bababadalgharaghtakamminnarronkonnbronntonneronntuon- thunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoordenenthurnuk""? There are many far greater works that not only tell the same story, but are readable and even enjoyable. My apologies to those who like Finnegan's Wake, but humanity is not best served by having its story told in gibberish."
Positive	The only book you'll ever need.: This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people.
Negative	"Do Not Buy This Version!: This version of ""Finnegans Wake"" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting ""Finnegans Wake"", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."
Negative	Less than impressed. Weak compared to his other works.: While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author.
Negative	Houston...we have a problem: I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world.
Negative	"Yikes!: I can't understand why anyone would spend 20 years writing thisThe book is incomprehensible. Read a regular book you can understand without having to read it aloudI love Joyce. Portrait, Dubliners, great stuff. Wonderful poetry. He starts to get a bit wonky in Ulysses, but even that is readable (if not altogether understandable - Giffords book is definitely a necessary provision)But why write a book such as the Wake? Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess. How was this even published? Didn't someone tap him on the shoulder and say, ""Joyce, this makes no sense""Good grief! Joyce was actually a decent writer to this point!"
Negative	"The Emperor Has No Clothes: FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."
Negative	Fails As Literature: Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page. If you hate it, you'll hate the rest. If you love it, you'll love the rest. The quality of the writing stays fairly consistent.
Negative	Finnegans Wake: Well, what can I say? This kind of writing would never make it past Mrs. Johnson, my 7th grade English and Grammar school teacher. I made many attempts at reading this gibberish. To those who like this book, kudos's to you few. I highly recommend this book as an anchor on night stands of insomniacs everywhere. I join the ranks of those who do not like this book. I'm sure there is something enriching in there, somewhere. Who was the editor? I know it was not Mrs. Johnson!Jimmy Lair
Negative	Kind of light and fluffy.: This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this. Reading this book will take about and hour and a half, though it will only feel like 20 minutes. Think Curious George. I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence).
Negative	I do not like Finnegans Wake: I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion. Ulysses and A Portrait managed to be both timelessly powerful and legible; it's a pity Joyce didn't make better use of his seventeen years.
Positive	This was a present for my husband: My husband said that they shoe is very comfortable and he would buy them again. I thought the price was very reasonable
Positive	Nursing as a Ministry: Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve.
Positive	Question of thought: How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi's philosophicaland ethical system of thought?
Positive	Genius: If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it. His wit, enthusiasm, courage, and extreme energy will keep you enthralled in his arguments. These are the two works by Nietzsche that give him his reputation as an extremist and genius.
Negative	defective, very disappointed: This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. The inside of each clear plastic pocket was covered with an extra layer of cheap, tear-able, thin plastic. Several places it was torn, creating a messy obstructed view for any pictures or words I would put in the plastic pockets. This made the product unusable.
Positive	I am pleased: Receiving this product was right on time. My opinion of the book was very informational for me.
Positive	Excellent insight: As a long-time Christian, I had to admit that my disciplines were somewhat haphazard. This book is not advocating legalism but encourages discipline while offering insight as to why it is important in order to live a rewarding God-pleasing Christian life. Put into practice, it will cause you to constructively strengthen your Christian walk.
Positive	This book has been a great influence in changing my life!: This book has been the book with the most impact on me outside of the Word of God. It has practical steps and illustrations on how to acheive a close and intimate walk with God. It plainly explains that having a close walk with God is not something mystical, but is something everyone should and can experience.
Positive	a good overview of the Christian walk: I was required to read this book for a seminary class. Many people found the book to be amazing, and felt that it really strengthened them. I enjoyed the book, but wouldn't list it as a favorite. However, if you're looking for insight into how to grow, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.
Negative	Signs of the times: Deceivers will rise up from among you and deceive many.This book is just a copycat of many books before it from Richard Foster,etal. This list of so-called Disciplines is straight from Richard Foster's Spiritual Formation curriculum, in which the occultist centering prayer method is taught. It is occultist to the core, but dressed up nicely as Christian.
Positive	Our bible study is using: We are about half way through and a majority of members have expressed they like the book. We are using this in conjunction with the study guide. We choose a few key study guide questions to discuss each week.The content is great, the use of scripture to support is pretty good, and the message is clear and pertinent.
Positive	Solid.: This book is a solid read and works well as a go-to-guide to spiritual disicplines. The section on journaling is dated, but perhaps you could draw a correltation to bloggin. Either way, it is worth a read.
Negative	"The Other Side Of A Christian Classic: Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
Negative	Disappointing . . .: I had read 5 or more rave reviews about this book and was excited to receive it. After reading it, I am sorry to say that it was not life changing, inspiring or even a good read. The book seems so childish to me. Maybe because I am 50 and the author is 29. Maybe the lessons she is trying to pass on I have learned a long time ago. Things like it's not O.K. to tease or take advantage of another person. . . Just disappointing. Maybe it is a good read for someone who hasn't done a great deal of living yet.
Negative	Not sure about veracity of the material: The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society.
Negative	Misleading: If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting.
Negative	Copyright BEFORE reading...: Single in Saudi is a complete work of FICTION! It says so in the copyright. I have made that mistake before so now I always check to see if it is fictional or is a true event or sadly ...true EVENTS! If you like autobiographical books or biographical as I do, always look for the copyright. Also, get the sample first. If you do not like fiction then you need not pay for it!!
Positive	Good Value, blew my GeForce 2 away: I love this card. It is a great value and supported DirectX 8.0 very well. It is a good value at only $.. compared to at least $... for a GeForce 4. The DDR memory really makes a difference over the SD in the GeForce. I replaced a GeForce 2 32mb with this card and did not have any problems installing it. My Pentium 4 with 394mb RDRAM and this card run Operation Flashpoint and Battlefield 1942 really well. A+
Negative	"Dual Moniter support doesn't work with 2 CRT's: I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
Positive	Good Product: I did't buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch movies that I had on my computer. The quality was not that bad and setup was fairly easy. Just follow the directions and your set. This card comes with an s-video output so it doesnt look that bad when it goes on tv. The price is pretty good and it does its job. The only expensive thing was when i had to get long audio and s-video cables.
Negative	an awful card: Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. Has many cool features, TV-out,dual moniter etc.Bad parts: my computer is 5 years old with a really crummy vid card, and i play a lot of online games with it. They usually run 20 or 30 frames per second, which is barable but i could do better. so i went to comp usa and the guy told me to get this one because it was plenty fast. I installed evrything properly but even after tweaking and adjusting to the max all i could get was 12 fps. This card was so useless i exchanged it for a PNY technologys Verto geforce 4 ti 4400 card, which rocks btw....rocks hard.
Negative	DON'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE: I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card. I tried all the right way of trying to cancell it, but it looks like Amazon can get a card ready for shipping within minutes of a purchase, but the delivery date is August 15. I have written you an email, now how long will it take to get a response with Amazon.
Negative	Doesn't block the heat much, flimsy mouse pad: Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops.
Positive	Great Product: Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow.
Positive	We like them: I purchased two Lapinator's plus, and two Mousitizer's for my wife and I. These were shipped to New Zealand and arrived within a week.We both have Alienware 15.4' laptops that are quite heavy and get a little warm :) (hot). I am always in shorts and we have both found them excellent.We like the way it protects our legs from the heat and the soft padding on the underside of them. Also we like that they are strong and can easily take the weight of our laptop's when we move then from our lap to a table etc.As to the 'mousitizer' we think they should be wider, that is from front to back, not wider, as out from the Lapinator. We both find/found that the mouse was a bit to far away for comfortable use. But as a add on to the Lapinator, it works well.
Negative	"Much, MUCH better available... I suggest you keep looking: I am not at all pleased with ""the Lapinator"" product. It is not rigid at all, the flimsy plastic top distorts from laptop heat, and it's not wide enough (and I have the larger one).[...] They are not terribly durable, lasting only about a year before suffering stress cracks, but they are great while they last!"
Positive	Love this, easy to use and makes working from the couch awesome!: This is so easy to use and keeps your laptop from overheating.I used this while I was laid up from knee surgery and it was great to be able to keep my leg up while continuing to work from home. Love it!
Positive	"It Works Great!: It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12"" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"
Positive	"Got a Laptop? You'll need the Lapinator/Mousitizer: I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. If I had paid attention to her use of the Lapinator with Mousitizer, I would have gotten one a long time ago. The lap table has space for my 17"" laptop and a clip-on USB LED light. The Mousitizer is what makes this combo work so well. The table itself insulates from the heat, and the Mousitizer fits snuggly to the table. I think the optional rubber bumper border is a must to block your wireless mouse from falling off at the slightest tilt of the table. I tried another laptop table brand that folds for travel, but at home I don't use anything but the Lapinator."
Negative	Laminator Plus: I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off.
Positive	Was Everything I was looking for: I ordered this strictly as a keyboard and mouse holder for my family room computer. I wanted to be able to game and browse comfortably from my couch. This works Perfectly. Allows my keyboard and mouse to stay securely in place even while moving. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a similar solution.
Positive	Great: I bought the lapinator and Mousitizer after a lot of searching (and a few failed home builds) so I could comfortably watch movies, play games etc on my bed in Iraq. I wasn't expecting much but when the Lapinator finally arrived it became a must have for several people in my living area. It was light weight and the non-skid feet would allow you to prop the computer up a little without worrying about it falling over. Even after a marathon session of gaming on an off day my legs we're hot from the laptop and the feet allow a good bit of air flow to go under the computer so even my computer was cooler than expected.! My only complaint is the mouse part is rather flimsy and putting a lot of pressure can cause it to fall off and just using it causes it to slant downward.4/5
Positive	Awesome Knife: This knife was everything i expected and more. This is one of the greatest all around knives i have ever seen. It is super strong, has a great wieght and balance, and of course it keeps a great edge... it is a benchmade. I highly recommend this knife to any outdoorsman, hunter, even our beloved soldiers in all of our armed forces. This knife will withstand most anything, and stay sharp with just a little TLC.
Positive	The BEST Book I've ever written -- JOHN JB WILSON.: I hope you have as much fun reading this humorous collection of film cliche's as I had writing it and collecting the movie stills which illustrate it. I know I wrote it, but I still laugh out loud at my favorite entries every time I pick it up. WHY NOT PICK UP A COPY YOURSELF
Negative	"Only posers & jocks enjoy this crap: I dont see how any one into real brutal music (deathmetal) can enjoy such crap specialy because all the songs here sound exectly like the previous...Why kids call repetition brutality? I dont understand that and never will because? Honestly? I hate hardcore music because only winps and jocks enjoy this garbage. Hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" has nothing good or great about it and all you straight edge fa*gots need to hang yourselfes... I quess im too old for this new generation so i rather listing to my morbid angel or death or possessed collection insted of this and you realy want to listing to actual brutal music? Listing to cryptopsy,disgore, severe torture, dyingfetus, necrophagist, and, devourment. Skip this trash."
Negative	Dont buy this!: I like alot of music but this I dont.I dont even think this should be called music.Every song sound the same.This cd is plain horribal.Dont buy it unless your on the highschool football team so you can fit in with the other jocks.
Positive	high quality: I'll keep this short, since you don't need much explaination. This album slams harder than just about any other. You'll listen to it all the way through at max volume. It will absolutly blow your mind. If it doesn't, check your pulse....
Positive	if you're angry, get it now !: This album is the very definition of metalcore.Very heavy songs, filled with anger and pain.I give it 4 stars because I think some lyrics could 've been improved, and some songs sound the same, But It's suerely a good album. Worlds apart is my favourite song.
Positive	Extremely Intense: I've heard a lot of very hard bands in my day, but few are able to produce the raw emotion and sound of Hatebreed. If you are looking for an album to get pumped up to, whether it be working out or preparing for a sporting event, this is one to add to your collection. The album's only faults are its short length and some of the songs sound too much alike.
Positive	"This is a very good hardcore band/CD: Hatebreed isn't a modern ""sell-out"" wannabe hardcore band. These guys are alsome and i suggest them to any hc fan..."
Negative	"Hatebreed is kind of awful: Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."
Negative	Worst band EVER!: nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. .
Positive	Except for drums, awsome: Hatebreed (CONNECTICUT HARDCORE!!!!!) is amazing except for the less that spectacular drumming. Hatebreed now has a new drummer however (Woohoo!), so they're now unstopable.
Positive	For the General Audience: This doesn't mean its bad, its simply mainstream. I mean, they dont bother tagging those on unless it is a widely known band. Hatebreed are not fanpleasers, great live, and have strangely undertstandable vox on this album. They've got the emotion many bands with the same formula lack, and thats what set them apart from others. They've got the feeling of hxc and the temps of mxc. It's not so much a blend of the two, but their own interpretation of both. This is beyond mediocre, but its not going to blow you away. They have more talent but this is the sound they like and their slight maturing of their sound is what keeps them going strong. This is what people see as a defining album, but its nothing of the sort, it simply excels at what its set out for. Breakdowns designed for the mosh it seems, if you get into it.
Positive	"Good metal.: They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song ""Last Breath"". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under ""Metalcore"". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official ""head banging, mosh pit"" band of today, and this album definitely shows it. It even comes with a poetic title."
Positive	"lovely: Many times i have seen this album cover and told myself "" they look like a ""bad"" punk band"" boy was i wrong ?Yes, very darn wrong ! The reason i used to think they were a punk band it's cause i had never seen them any where and i actullie support every local,underground, and ,upcoming band there is... Weather its grincore,blackmetal,thrash,death,metalcore,hardcore,emocore and,punkrock and i never heard about hatebreed ? but upon buying hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" i found myself to be very happy and proud at the fact that i own something that sounds agressive and intense as hatebreed's ""satisfaction is the death of desire"" not only is this disc worth own it but also here you have great, great political subjects! As for a fav song ? mmm i'll go with ""last breath"" those riffs are just fantastic !! Peace son !"
Negative	junk SENT Back: Poor Speaker Hook up thin wires only spealker nut for main speaker thin wire push pins for surround.2. No co-ax hook up for ant if you neek a Terk power antenna no way. Fm reception poor.3. Dumb hard to use manualI sent mine back and for a few bucks more bought a decent Sony.
Positive	essential: Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A true masterpiece of Reggae.
Negative	"A Disservice to Martial: This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."
Negative	Disappointed: The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can't close your hand when it is on. Returning the item was even more difficult. While I returned it within one week of purchase, it took 7 weeks and a complaint filed with Amazon to get my refund. If you do purchase from this seller & ultimately have to return something be very sure you get a tracking number or receipt confirmation. Without that I would still be waiting for my money.
Positive	BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!!!!!!!: This book has the most beautiful pictures in a book that I've seen!!!!!! I do not know how someone could be so talented to be able to draw those kinds of pictures!
Positive	Amazing Resource: This non-fiction book is used every year in my 4th grade class. It is a great addition to the Iditarod unit that I teach! It's loaded with artistic drawings and anecdotes. The kids love it! Highly recommend.
Positive	von Igelfeld for the win!: I think this may be McCall Smith's funniest work, and strangely his most endearing. His affection for his characters - three very thin, very tall, very overeducated linguists - is obvious in every paragraph. The humor that ensues from Professor Doctor Doctor von Igelfeld's adventures and misadventures is honest and endearing, while gently reminding us not to take ourselves quite so seriously.
Negative	Relaxing entertainment: I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
Positive	good old fashion storey: great to see jean claude in a non-martial arts movie, not a oscar winner by any mean, but a good storey , up dated by modern advances in photography, see it, and see history, the way it was..
Positive	"this movie is far UNDERrated: I'd never even heard of ""Legionaire"" until a skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" (where Kris Kattan portrayed VanDamme) made fun of the fact that nobody saw this movie. I of course thought that this movie must be godawful, so I rented it just to be entertained by its horribleness. But I was amazed at what a great movie this was! It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good. I'm surprised that a decent movie like this goes straight to video while other movies which are far more lame and stupid make it to the big screen. If you rent it you won't be disappointed, especially if you have low expectations to begin with"
Positive	"one of ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"" ...: Was that even a Van Damme film ? ... oh well , that's how I would discribe this Van Damme film .Great sets , Great locations , Great costumes , Great props , ok acting ... this is Van damme after all !The only 2 things I could complain about is the fact that Van Damme was a little bit cheesy about being proud to be a LEGIONAIRE and the ending ( I wont spoil it) .... it just seemed prodictable to me .All in all , this is a good film and I recommend this as one of the best Van Damme films ."
Negative	van damn this was terible: This would be the worst van dam movie I ever seen not a good plot. I am used to so much more from van dam that this movie was disappointing
Negative	Good action shots but a pitiful storyline that yawns: 2.5 Stars because the action scenes are great, but the plot is simplistic and the semblance at drama pathetic, with irritating stabs of shallow sentimentalism and worn cliche. Worth renting but not worth buying unless you want good action shots and are a Van Damme fanatic. I will sell my DVD if I can. A previous review compares this to Glory, but I consider the comparison far-fetched, unless action is the sole criteria.
Negative	LegionnAire: LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Van Damme should stick with doing Katate movies not acting movies
Negative	"Legionnaire: This movie is the worst Van Damme movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I found myself drifting in and out of deep sleeps while I was watching this boring film. Please, do not waste your time or money in renting or buying this movie. It has only one ""Van Damme"" style fight scene throughout the whole movie. Not his best, his worst."
Negative	"A GREAT IDEA WASTED: VAn Damme's movies were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one ... Then a good idea came up: why don't try to make a kind of ""epic"" movie, taking a lengendary theme (the French unit called ""Foreigner Legion"" )and changing from the custumary scenario of karate kicks and sterotyphed villains who want to rule the world ? Great idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will never improve as an actor... EVery frame of the movie is wasted, making us think that he is being bad orientated by his agents or film-producers. IT's a totally unconving history, without pace and rhythm..."
Negative	definitly van Damme's worst!: this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! And definitly van Damme worst ever!The only reason I normally watch his films for is his fighting ability...but there's like no fighting in this one...and the rest of the action is nothing special....and this isn't even the worst part of the movie....the worst is the sotry it has to it......very pathetic altogether...skip this one!
Positive	Good Movie, worth watching: This movie was good, because it show's that Van Damme doesn't have to kick the crap out of people to star in a movie. It has a good story to it and some emotional scenes that show Van Damme's true acting abilities. Definitly worth renting.
Positive	Very Good Movie: This is a very good Van Damme movie. It is not his best movie. But I would have to say it was his best acting. Great action scenes.
Positive	A moving and touching film, with plenty of action: Van Damme scores big in this movie. Finally he has picked a movie with a decent supporting cast and a good story. Unlike previous films, Van Damme's kickboxing and martial arts skills are blended nicely with real life situations and drama. This movie deserved a theatrical release, the action is tasteful and the movie has a quick but meaningful pace. Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles. Lionheart has the same tug on the heart strings, as well as the Legionaire angle.
Positive	Good,but its not like his other movies: I went the store and i saw this movie on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the movie was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne.This is like the only movie i didnt see him do his fancy kicks.This movie is worth watching,but if u wanna see his kicks dont get this one.
Negative	Boring Van Damme Movie: Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood.
Negative	The movie is a mute to 21 million hard of hearing people.: There is no close caption to the movie, and it is very boring, due to not understanding what is going on without close caption. Remeber there are 21 million deaf and/or hard of hearing people in U.S.A. that depends on close caption. If ypu cut our close caption off, then the rating falls way down.
Negative	did not like it: I purchased this book after I read the good reviews. I really did not like it. The story was dull, the heroine uninteresting and the hero not a hero at all (but just some idiot).
Positive	Great fit for 70# lab mix: I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption.
Negative	could not get my dog to wear it: i tried everything but he hated it. it was a no go. even though i set it to a snug fit, he kept pawing at it until he was finally able to get it into his mouth and chew on it.
Negative	No: These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn't able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Not a good idea.
Positive	Pulling is Over: A must for a determined puller, not for the dog but us owners! Near instantaneous better walking. Buddy still needs it after about three weeks. I thought he would get the idea and then I could stop using it. Not true yet and maybe never, which will not be so bad. A little bit of a pain to put on when he wants to go for a walk. Also, he has already chewed the plastic clasp and I had to buy another. His bad allowed by my not making sure it was up and away while we were out. Buddy is a puppy that requires training. Holt is a well thought out product that is effective. I recommend it.
Positive	Sizing is a little off: I agree with the other reviewer about the sizing. 0 is supposed to be for a doxie size, but my Jack Russell/Pug (20lbs) mix can slip out of it when it's not set super tight. We have a min-pin mix, about 11lbs, and I worry if we order another 0 it will be too big. Honestly 0 should fit the smallest dog, not a 25 pounder! Still a good product despite the sizing issues and the cost is good compared to other's.
Positive	Good tool to help with pulling: Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!
Negative	All Chewed Up: My dog also chewed one of the straps, and the halti is now useless. Be aware that you have to closely watch your dog when you use the halti to make sure he is not chewing it. I was very surprised to find the halti ruined when I took it off of my dog because I was less than 3 feet away the entire time he wore it.
Negative	Disappointing: At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money.
Positive	works: really work as they said it would instant control. nice walking a dog that doesn't pull you off your feet the moment you go out the door. longer walks more at ease
Negative	"It's a fake: The collar actually works fine but it's not a Halti. It's a 'Holt"" Looks and works the same but it's not a Halti which is what I was ordering."
Negative	Doesn't work with either of my dogs....: We have two Bernese Mountain dogs. Niether will use this collar. They fight to get it off the entire time. Tugging on it does not get their attention. PetCo also expects you to just mail items back with no documentation. Return for this is not handled by Amazon...
Positive	Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix: What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. This training collar distracts her from pulling because it is positioned under her mouth. She did not like it initially and tried to take it off, but then she concentrated on the walk itself.Another nice feature of this collar is that it is adjustable in the front under her nose, so if it is hot outside and the dog has to pant she can open her mouth.The collar is supposed to attach to a regular collar that the dog wears all the time, although I used it as a single collar on my dog.
Negative	Broke on second use: I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
Positive	Works well: This Halti collar worked well at controlling my Great Dane. He learned not to pull very quickly.
Negative	Didnt last long: The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that.
Negative	"Not a Halti: Ordered a Halti training collar and received, on time, a Holt collar. Called seller, not respones. ""Returns require prior authorization code,"" but request was routed to a ""mailbox full"" number. No follow up from seller."
Negative	Sizing instructions are off: The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
Positive	halti: I have a 100 lb lab- australian shepherd mix. When we are out walking he tends to forget that I exist whenever he sees a new dog, and he is strong enough to pull me over. I have tried several different approaches, including a choke chain, without a lot of success.The halti has worked better than anything else I have tried. He has been able to remove it a couple of times, but since it ended up around his neck, he was not able to get away from me.
Positive	Takes some getting used to: I purchase this head collar on advice from a friend. I have been using it for my great dane mix who is a puller. She didn't like the collar at first, but I am sticking with it and she is adjusting. It is well made and working out great. It also comes with some training tips that are helpful. I would definitely recommend this collar.
Positive	LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR: This walking collar has the greatest design. I do not have to have great upper body strength to control my excited boxer. She walks next to me like she is supposed to. No more pulling me down the street. Bravo
Negative	Flawed Design.: My 10 month old lab chewed through this product within five minutes of his first walk. Thank god for the safety connected to the collar or who knows what would have happened.The design has a strap that goes right over the side of the mouth area. As the dog opens and closes their mouth, the strap goes tight and slack. When the strap is slack, the dog can chew on it. I would say that this is a major design flaw on a product designed to restrain your dog while on a walk.I wouldnt say that my dog is particularly bright so if he can figure this out within 5 minutes on his first walk I'm sure any dog can. If you are going to buy this, please make sure you attach the safety strap to the collar.
Positive	Take More Pixs: I upgraded to the 128 MB Smart Media card by Simpletech and was very happy with the added storage ability for photos. It's well worth it. It's rugged, fast and works with other devices. More bang for the buck. Get it!
Negative	Not compatible with all Smart Media devices: Although this card fit well into my Rio500 MP3 player, I had to call Simpletech's 800 # and punch through a long phone tree to reach a helpful technician. He explanined that Rio 500's can't take more than 64MB, so I'll have to send it back and pay for shipping.Find a way to verify compatibility before ordering.
Negative	SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands: I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. I timed how long it took to copy the same 5MB file to each card. The result: the other cards took 32 seconds and the SimpleTech took 38 seconds. So, my results show that the SimpleTech is about 18% slower than the others. That's important to me because when I take action shots I'm often waiting for the previous image to write to disk before I can take the next shot.
Positive	Get it, your digital camera will love you for it!: I purchased a brand new Fuji FinePix A201 and wanted to take more pictures with it... came with a small Smartmedia card. So I decided to upgrade and get the Simpletech 128MB SM card. Now I can take a bunch of pictures without changing SM cards so often. Oh yeah, get the Simpletech Smartmedia Flashlink reader, it will get your images from your camera to the PC fast!!
Negative	Worst Alternate Idea: This is the latest in the stargate movies, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know.While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.As this movie Sorry Stargate fans it is not worth it.
Negative	disappointed: I've seen better episodes on TV. Forgettable, don't even remember what it was about and it wasn't long ago that I saw it.
Negative	This is the single worst quality blu-ray I have seen yet.: The movie was ok, as much as a let down as 200 was, but at least it was ok.Blu-ray on a decent TV makes this thing look like utter and complete crap.I returned it to the store to get the DVD because at least that doesn't look as bad.The lack of quality on the picture makes me ashamed to be a fan.
Negative	Stargate: Continuum: I didn't recieve the DVD at all, was really looking forward to watching it :( makes me sad....... Wendy Johnson
Negative	Not a fan of Continuum: I was disappointed.My wife, who is the big stargate fan, was also. She watched it a second time and said she was glad she bought it ... after being really disappointed on the first viewing.If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw. It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.Anyway, glad to give my opinion for what it is worth.Save your money for something that is worth watching.
Negative	Bad return service: I was shipped two when I order only one! The return menu did not have a selection that covered the return and I was charged shipping to return the extra item!
Negative	Stargate Continuum: Not bad but could have been a lot better. Overall it was dissapointing. They could have at least noted what happened to the Ori after leaving fans hanging with the series ending. Not worth buying.
Positive	Great for any Stargate Fan!: Too bad good shows do not last forever, but this DVD continues the Stargate tradition. It is good fun!
Positive	"A Nice Continuation: I thought ""Continuum"" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise. There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama. Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance. This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection."
Positive	Continuum: Good fun. There's action amd tension and lightness to make gripping and entertaining a storyline that might otherwise be somewhat predictable. Ben Browder in particular manages to inject pathos and humour as well as being delightful eye candy.Highly recommended.
Positive	Pretty good.: This movie is pretty good. It didn't require an indepth knowledge of the TV show to follow the movie.
Positive	Great movie.: If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
Positive	great: It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
Positive	Stargate Continuum: So glad I purchased the movie. I love the Stargate series and this was very good. The story line and characters kept the action moving
Positive	Great job on this one: I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story. This, however, was a really, really good film. It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one. The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.It wasn't perfect, however.People vanishing from an altered timeline... That just doesn't happen. There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers. Great job by everyone.Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!
Negative	"A Stargate Movie: My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in ""SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak"". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."
Positive	A GREAT story, BUT ......: I REALLY enjoyed this movie. And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back. Uhhh ... DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise.
Positive	The best of SG-1: This is a great episode. It was good to see Don Davis as General George Hammond for the last time. It was a parade of many loved characters, though Braytac and Dr. Fraiser were missing. I love the alternate universe stories and this was just as good. I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Star Gate.
Positive	"Continuum makes the grade!: A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
Positive	A great series and great movies: I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori. I think that anyone who liked the series should get it. I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
Positive	"One of the top 3 Stargate movies ever made.: Spoiler Free ReviewThe title there is a joke since this is the third movies in the series, along with The original feature that spawned the series, and the ""Ark of Truth."" I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as I expected. The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.My biggest complaint is the time traveling and alternate timeline themes didn't do enough to capture your imagination the way ""Back to the Future"" films do. But if you are a Stargate Fan, this is a can't miss DVD/bluray."
Negative	Yawn: I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series.
Negative	disappointed: I read all those wonderful reviews and then watched the film. I was disappointed and felt like another reviewer - let down.I have been a Stargate SG1 and Stargate Alantis fan for years. It was cool to see them together for a brief few moments but then it turned out to be another episode. Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development? This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner. Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind. Admittedly, I did rewind the first time but then didn't bother for the second and third. I was getting bored.I wish it was more and I think the disappointment was in I expected it to be more than just another episode. Everything was so predictable - a cash cow.I am so glad I rented. I won't waste my money.
Negative	Stunk: I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
Negative	Seriously Disappointing: The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing.
Positive	Stargate SG1...Continuum: I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last! They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations.
Positive	Excellent fun!: The Ark of Truth was an o.k. movie. I liked it because it is Stargate and because I wanted to see the actors again. Continuum, on the other hand, is superb. The story is great, the actors are fabulous - that's what SG1 was all about a couple of years ago.
Positive	"Stargate: The Review: Slow at times, but overall an excellent and fun addition to the Stargate story. Over the years I've thoroughly enjoyed any episode that deals with using the gate for other purposes than just ""going off-world"" - intentionally or unintentionally. The way this story happened - as a result of Ba'al trying to manipulate an entire galaxy just to save himself from being destroyed (how self-absorbed the Goau'ld can be) - seemed very in-line with the Stargate universe and a natural adventure SG-1 would have.I like the treat at the end with the picture in the locker.From a strictly ""Amazon.com purchaser"" perspective, I pre-ordered the item and it arrived within 24-hours, even with 2-day shipping. Package was whole and unspoiled (no shipping mishaps) when it was delivered."
Positive	Awesomeness: As sad as it is that the series had to end, at least they have awesome movies to follow it up with.
Positive	Excellent!: This is a great addition to the Stargate universe. You see all the favorite characters and get an actual end to an on-going storyline. I enjoy it a lot.
Negative	"Continuum, can't compare to Ark: Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (""2001"" or ""2010"") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."
Negative	"Borrow, don't buy!: A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Better than ""Ark of Truth"",but not much."
Positive	Stargate is Great: Really miss this show. It is fun to watch the episodes and see the characters interplay. I am ready for the next Stargate show to begin.I did not realize how long the show had been on for.
Positive	Great Movie: Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch
Positive	Wow! Great Movie: What a great addition to the SG-1 series. This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series. I think everyone from the writers, actors, and production crew were spot on with this movie.
Positive	"Best ""Episode"" Yet: I love Stargate SG-1 and I've seen every episode, most more than once, and I think Continuum is the best ""episode"" yet. It is truly movie quality and belongs on the big screen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, not just Stargate fans."
Positive	Outstanding: Even for someone who wasn't a huge fan of the show, this movie is a must see. Clever story, great flick!
Positive	Ausome! but...: If you liked Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, or Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Then you will most likely enjoy this film. The plot was... different. I enjoyed it but it seemed to go by fast.Stars: *****
Positive	A feature length episode, but a good one: With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al. He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day. Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching. But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run.
Positive	Miss the series: I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie.
Positive	"Loved This one, but I hated the ""Ark Of Truth."": Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."
Positive	StarGate Fan: Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement.
Positive	In My World of Stargate Continuum: It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. The seller was fast, the package was secured, and more important, I was happy when I got it. Once it arrived, I took it out of the package and popped it in the DVD player. When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go. I am now starting my collection of the series since there are a lot of episodes I've never gotten to see. For me, I like watching the behind the scenes portion. I write screenplays myself and so I learn a lot from the director's and actor's point of view. If you're not into that stuff, it's still a kick to watch! I can even deal with the historical babble that Daniel rattles off. Enjoy the ride!
Negative	"DisCONTINUUM immediately!: The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
Negative	A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down: I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline.
Negative	My least favorate episode,or movie of any stargate: I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!
Negative	Not satisfied: I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners
Negative	Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray.
Positive	I Loved This Movie: I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it. I think it would have been even better if he had gone with them to save the world at the end, but regardless of that I still have to give the movie 5 stars.
Negative	pleasent fluff: this was pleasent and satifying fluff. It's always worth while to watch Baal's machinations, but it would have played better as an episode.Sorry I can't say more.
Positive	Stargate Continuum: I enjoyed this movie but I still want more...I absolutely loved Stargate SG1, the relationships among the actors was fabulous. If you are a diehard fan like myself you will love this movie as well.
Positive	another continuem: a solid stargate movie but verry anticlimatic it just ends to fast in the end and left a lot to desire
Positive	I Approve: Watch it you will enjoy it. I not a fan of the Stargate series, but I enjoyed how this cleaver concept was exercuted in this self contained episode.
Positive	stargate sg1 continuum: If you like sg-1 and the adventures dealing with time travel, this movie is quite enjoyable. Yes, some of the old sequences are there (Teal'c as first prime but wants to be free), but, new twists with Vala and Ba'al. The story still leaves open the idea that other Goaul'd may be around, but the last major god has been vanquished.
Positive	Amazingness in DVD form =): Richard Dean Anderson brings so much to this latest installment of the SG-1 saga. RDA, the entire cast, a wicked awesome plot, and the fact that the arctic scenes were shot on location makes this movie all that much more awesome!
Positive	Happy Purchase: I love everything that has to do with Stargate. From the original Stargate movie with Kurt Russell and James Spade to the Stargate SG1 Series and Stargate Atlantis, I've been hooked for a while now. I love these shows and will always be a fan.
Positive	Too little too late: This would have been a good season finale and season start, but to do it as a farewell episode. I liked the Ark of Truth better. This episode had a lot of concentrated action and a lot of wasted time. They could have made it longer with a bit more of what happens to them when they are not involved. It was not their best effort but it was still Stargate.
Negative	"Old plots with very little action.: Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
Negative	Blu-ray quality same as upconverted DVD: The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before. There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great). Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself. When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof? The paradoxes are ridiculous.. like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US. if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place. where did Baal get Anubis's ship? how did Daniel's leg reappear? why make mitchell the hero? you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.I think the only thing I enjoyed was Vala as a villain.
Negative	"Close but no cigar: This movie includes all of the traditional ""Stargate"" favorites, from Jack O'Neill to General Landry, but without the humor that made the series so enjoyable. It plays as though the writers and the director had a checklist instead of a script. Quip for Oneill-check, Brilliant insight by Carter-check, Moral stance for Daniel Jackson-check. None of the elements are truely integrated. Watching this convoluted tale was a large disappointment."
Positive	coolest movie ever!!!!!: i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth movie... this one is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the continued story line of the evil but suave gould Bal is just so well crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat/sofa/bean bag... what ever your setting on:) if you are a huge sg-1 fan, you have to watch this!
Positive	great item: SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does.
Positive	Could have been better.: I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over.
Positive	Good movie... Stargate SG-1 is still a good team...: Stargate: Continuum is a good movie that brings together all of the SG-1 characters again... This is a funny & poignant movie, full of some surprises, that creates a dramatic to way to more or less tie up some loose ends when the series ended. I enjoyed it.
Positive	Stargate fan: I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. This movie was excellent. I would highly recommend it.
Positive	Waited too long to buy one!: The best rice we've ever made. All claims provided by Cooks Illustrated are true. Excellant product that is so easy to use!
Negative	This rice cooker is a disappointment to Asia!: my rice cooker of 10 years just crapped out and i read bunch of reviews and that really didn't help me. since this got so many reviews and most of them good i ordered it and the price is right. well, it makes rice but if you eat rice every day but don't want to make it every day then this rice cooker isn't for you. the steamer plug thing kicks back tons of water back into the pot so you get this really really wet spot. then there is this hot spot so it starts to burn and the bottom starts to get really crispy a couple of hours into the warm position. then after about 12 hours it starts to get this wet rag smell. gross!!
Negative	Not Good: Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product.
Negative	Difficult to clean: I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. My old rice cooker had a separate lid and I never noticed this difference in my research. This one is fixed on. I wish I had read the review that said the same thing I am now saying and took note. It's impossible to clean around all the gaskets and time consuming to try. Major design flaw. Other than that, it does make great rice.
Negative	Not worth the money...: After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again.
Positive	"Perfect rice, every time: This rice cooker is so easy to use: decide how many cups of rice to make, throw it in, put in water up to the line that matches the number of cups of rice, close the lid and plug it in, and you're done. Total cooking time for one cup of white rice, which is about right for two people, is about 15-20 minutes. We've noticed that leaving the rice in the cooker for an extra 10 minutes after it switches to ""warm"" produces perfect rice almost every time.Buy this cooker and stop trying to cook rice in a pot. Perfect rice with no effort is no longer just a dream."
Negative	Rice cooker: Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
Negative	defective after 1 month: Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit.
Positive	Nice job.: Spattered a bit, but did a good job of making rice. Porridge? Do they mean oatmeal? What about cooking macaroni and cheese--no info for that in booklet. Have not tried it for soup.
Negative	Huge disappointment!: I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand. Pay the extra money to get a real Japanese one, not an import.
Negative	You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker.: The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
Negative	Easy Rice: I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect.
Negative	worst rice cooker: After i reviewed various rice cookers in Amazon, I bought this one,hoping rice warm and fresh for at least 24 hours. I was wrong. First time I thought I cooked rice wrong to have dry rice on the surface, on the bottom almost no taxture porridge kind of rice within 24 hours . No. it wasn't my cooking method. This is so poorly made rice cooker, even it is said keep rice at least 24 hours fresh. I am wondering how this one get so much good review. This is another reason not to buy at the Amazon,if you are not sure about the item. Buy your local store, and return it when products disppointed in you. I had few cheap rice cookers, couldn't keep rice warm, at least it dosen't make rice dry and porridge at same time. Don't buy this products. Amazon suggest customers no returnable item to sell in their market place, how dare to sell this item to another person, I feel shame to do about this rice cooker.
Negative	Don't like this at all...: I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace.
Positive	Perfect: I bought this specifically for making brown rice as I could never get a good texture on a conventional stove -- it's makes wonderful brown rice.
Negative	non-stick coating peel off after 6 month: I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years.
Positive	"Basic and just right: This Sanyo rice cooker is just right for cooking rice (what a concept!). It's a plain Jane, but does the job very well. The cooked rice is tender without being mushy, the grains individual and not stuck together in a gummy mess. It's easy to adapt rice cooker recipes - ""The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" is a terrific companion and clean-up is fast.If you're looking for a basic rice cooker without the bells and whistles of various programs, this is a good one to choose."
Positive	good cooker: Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm. So now I just double check 5-10 min after. Works well for brown rice.
Positive	Rice Cooker: This is an AMAZING product! It makes PERFECT rice every time, never sticks to the pot and is amazingly easy cleanup! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!
Positive	Yuki: It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet.
Negative	ok, while it lasted....: It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened....
Positive	"darned, good rice cooker: i'd read/ researched much before purchasing this item. checked ""Consumer Reports"" as well as read many reviews about his particular model. most were helpful/ spot on: this is probably the best little bugger out there on the market today for the price (which we thought was reasonable). i'd have given 5/5 stars be it not for the pesky, little, plastic condensation capturer-thingy-device on the back of the unit. it does its job OK but is a bit of a struggle to get re-situated in place after emptying, cleaning, etc. it cooks rice to perfection, clean-up is a breeze, etc. however, the plastic spoon that comes w/ the product doesn't fit very well into the resting ""slot"" affixed to the side of the top lid. other than those two, slight ""inconveniences"", the product is terrific."
Positive	"Works as Advertised: Being Japanese-American, I have been raised around rice cookers since birth. The old models my family used had the lid bobbing on the steam being generated; the rice was perfect regardless. The ""fancy"" models now being sold for over a $100 are overkill. This machine follows the ""KISS"" principle to a T. While the lid doesn't bobble anymore due to the vent, it works fine. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I cannot see the water level markings. They are the same color as the non-stick coating."
Negative	"Broke!: This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
Positive	A book that fills the gap in Polish inter-war history.: For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery. This book fills that gap admirably. It reveals how Jozef Pilsudski was truly the founding father of a reborn nation. This is his story just as much as Poland's, but then the two are so closely tied together that their's is one story. A fascinating and easy read. Thoroughly recommended to those who have an interest in this area.
Positive	Great Resource!: This is a fantastic resource for any teacher. The ideas generated in this book are invaluable and can be modified for any age/grade level. Forms are instantly usable. Great for someone who's never seen a rubric right up to those who use them all of the time. I can't wait to share it with all the teachers at my school!
Positive	"Rubrics for Elementary Assessment : Classroom Ready Blacklin: Great tool for the primary classroom. Best purchase I've made in years for my teaching and assessment. No more questioning of ""why"" a grade is given. Well worth the price!!"
Positive	mu-sic , n.: Musiq Soulchild: This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son.
Positive	Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!1: I've only had it for less than 2 weeks, and have to buy another one because I've scratched it taking it between the car and house. You have got to get this cd if you haven't already! Number 9, 10, and second part of 11 are my favorites.
Positive	"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT: I have to say that this Musiq's best cd so far. His lyrics are just so...real. Unlike rappers... he doesn't sing about the same thing over and over...he sings about real situations....like is ""babymother"" OMG I LOVEEE that song...KEEP IT UP MUSIQ!!!!"
Negative	TAKE OFF THE SHADES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I got a song:why did i buy it?the second was wack tooi'm such a foolfor those shades hiding cross-eyed dudesi hated the singleit was 9.99how bad could it benow i'm selling it for free
Negative	"Don't Believe The Hype!: I am a fan of Musiq - don't get me wrong. I really liked his first two albums, so I was thoroughly outraged when I bought/heard ""Soulstar"". Nowhere on the same level! It lacks so much of the ""soul"" that ironically labels it. Honestly, pick up ""Dwele - Subject"" or ""Kem - Kemistry"" instead. This album is not hot, don't believe the hype! And whoever said that Musiq in on the same level as Maxwell, must be deaf! At any rate, the best song on the entire album is ""forthenight"" (for the night), which they play so frequently on the radio. If you're curious, let one of your friends lend it to you (if they have it), or ask them to burn it for you... I wouldn't recommend blowing your hard-earned moolah on this soul-less atrocity. ;o("
Positive	Musiq makes good musiq: This is a nice album. Not really a 5 star album, but I still like it. My favorite track is Babymother. I love the subject and chorus of this song. If you like Musiq, cop it.
Negative	Mr.Average: and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short.
Negative	Whack: What's good with this album. His first album was a classic and the second was good. This is just whack. His voice is not up to par like Glenn Lewis, Bilal, Maxwell and D'Angleo. Come on,are some of you people deaf? He can't carry a note.
Positive	How could you say a bad word about it???: I don't understand how anyone can possibly trash this CD. If you ever liked Musiq you should def. love this CD--From the incredible Soulstar intro to the very end of Givemorelove/Leaveamessage. The whole Cd is a standout against all other music in the insdustry. He's def. an original artist.Please don't let these reviewes sway you against buying this CD--listen to the samples yourself and if you dont like it you just don't like music/musiq.
Positive	Musiq does it again!!!: When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!
Positive	Gon' hed Musiq: I love this CD..I am a big Musiq fan.. This cd is good from beginning to end. The musiq is very pretty..and what I love about him is that he is so creative he talks about things other people really dontMy favorite tracks are#1 Soulstar#3 Womanolopy#6 whoknows..very pretty track#7 babymother...I love this track#12 Her#13 whereareyougoingall the real Musiq fans stand up..and go get my boy's cd..its tight..it deserves more than 5 stars
Negative	Is Musiq losing his touch?: This by far was the worst of the three albums from Musiq. It definetly does not live up to the traditional Musiq style that I am used to. The lyrics are ok, but the beats are not as tight as the first album which was by far the best. Or even the second album which was not as good as the first but it was ok. It seems like with each album Musiq's rhythms start to wander off. Musiq is known for his beats, rhythms, sounds and mezmorizing words in his songs. Did he get new producers or something? If so he needs to go back to the original ones because this album is the worst by far. Musiq I know you can do much better!
Positive	"Chalk another good CD for Musiq: Musiq's new CD is fantastic effort. Even though his music has generally maintained the same format, there are some slight differences with this CD than his previous ones. It seems as if he went for more of an orchestrated feel with this one. In many songs, there are quite a but of this. And it works out really well. There are a lot of strong tracks on here. My favorite tracks are ""moment in life"" w/Kindred and Cee-Lo, ""womanopoly"" and ""infatueighties"". There's pretty much only one song I can't stand and that is ""miss you"". And there's another song that I'm indifferent about, so this prohibits me from giving it a perfect 5 stars, but this is nothing but quality and I would definitely recommend it to most fans of R&B and Hip-Hop. At least those who aren't swayed by most of the mainstream trash that they hear on the radio."
Positive	A Soul Star he is: this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. I'm addicted. There is nothing sad on this album (except for the very serious song babymother {about becoming an unexpectant father}). It's a feel good CD. Even the leaveamessage track is fun.
Positive	LOVE!: I really like his music and enoy to listening to it all the time. I would recommend this cd to everyone.
Positive	Quality: Thanks for giving me such a great product. I could not tell that this CD was used at all. It was taken very well care of. No scratches, skips or anything! Keep up the good work!
Positive	"Best Album So far!!!!!!: Musiq did it again every song on here i like to some sort but my favorite, favorite , is ""Momentinlife"" with kindred and cee-loguiness!!!I recommend this to all the ""real musiq Lovers""I agree with the other person who said that Kindred was overlooked cause that was the truth. They did not get the credit that was due. come on yall lets get the Real Artist to the top cause that is where Real music Lives and is created. They Deserve it! But anyway Musiq Wonderful job it just gets better and better."
Negative	F for effort: COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly? Baby Mama Drama? What about love longs and decent ones at that. The second CD was a keeper. Musiq should practice his craft or lose a fan. Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it.
Negative	The second was better, the first was best: I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe, hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again.
Positive	Reflective and Multi-layered: Still Love in Strange Places takes readers on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Kephart is really asking the questions, To whom do memories and stories belong? and How are cultural legacies passed down to a child. A fascinating book.
Negative	Don't waste your time: If you want to play chess, go grab a real chess board.1. The two player mode isn't really two players. You have to share the same controller. Yes, you literally have to pass the controller back and forth for every move.2. No one plays this game on Xbox Live.
Positive	"Searched for this song...: Heard the song on Charlie's Angels movie and it wasn't listed on the soundtrack. Did some research and finally found the song. Love the ""dance"" music beat!"
Positive	very happy: These are great tires for my old beach cruiser. Size was perfect and a fraction of the price the bike shop charges!
Positive	I disagree with just about all of these reviews...: These are the same games you remember from the eighties....of course they seem basic by today's standards, but if you loved them like I did you will be very happy with this game. No duh pac man and ms. pacman are the same game....we knew that in 1983. The point is, you will likely buy this game out of nostalgia, not because you are looking for the next huge special effects dynamo p.c. game. If you loved these games 20 years ago, you'll enjoy the heck out of this game because they are the exact same games simply made playable on the Xbox.
Negative	won't play on my xbox: when I insert the disk the screen says you must attach hard drive to play. i have a 4 gig hard drive attached but it still won't play
Negative	Poor renditions of classic games: These versions do not play like the original games. I'm amazed that they don't just write an emulator so that they can get their games right!
Negative	Not Just a Name: Just like a real museum, everything in Namco Museum is OLD. I grew up in the 80's. I played Atari and Colico. I remember Pong, Missile Command and many others. I remember that they only kept my attention for about twenty minutes at a time.
Negative	"Industrial, though not ""Professional"": I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals ""I Didn't See It Coming"" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."
Positive	"Five Stars For Children's Version: This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones. There are no bawdy barroom scenes. Levity is provided by the addition of several animals. Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that ""parrots"" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat. Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of ""color"" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back."
Positive	I think Scratch was exciting and romantic in this book.: I feel Scratch had to have closure on the past as he had to find out the three men he first road with had in deed betrayed him and took his firs and left him to fend for his self. I am glad Scratch found the men and set things right. We need more of Titus C. Bass pleasd don't let him fade into the sunset.
Positive	"More than happy!: This book arrived looking just as nice as a brand new one, even though it was listed as, ""Used."" Very pleased and would highly recommend this seller!"
Positive	short and complete: I recommend this book to all of my friends because it is very thorough and very short! This is especially helpful if the other parent isn't much of a reader (at least about child development) I highlight a few chapeters when I want my husband to understand more about what our daughter is going through.
Positive	Every second counts: Will my future change because of this one second I stopped to look at this dress in the window? Will I alter other peoples' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie. 'Run Lola Run', a German movie, is fantastically made and keeps your heart beating rapidly down to the last second of it. Lola's boyfriend got into trouble. And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip. Fast, unstopable, exciting. And the one minute you spent thinking about getting this movie will change your life.
Positive	Everything as advertised.: I saw this movie in my German class, and I thought it was a cool enough movie to buy and own. The DVD did not disappoint : )
Positive	"Totally Engrossing!: I don't think I have ever watched a movie move as fast as this one--couldn't believe it when it was over. It's exciting, innovative, visually perfect, and accompanied by terrific music. The characters are appealing and interesting. There was never a slow moment nor a wasted frame. ""Run Lola Run"" is as good as it gets."
Positive	"Lots of form, and lots of fun....: Not quite sure what was going on here....kinda reminded me of a cross between Groundhog Day and the multiple-endings in ""Clue"", but fun nonetheless. Very energetic film that FLIES by!This DVD edition features and English soundtrack, as well as the German soundtrack, and the english subtitles can be turned on if you are a purist watching the German-language version. Also, the disc is two-sided, one side being full-screen, the other being letterbox."
Positive	Very interesting.... like nothing i have seen before: In my German class, one boy brought this movie in. I really didn't know what to expect, because most movies we see in German class are a bit old.. this one is very different, and creative. I have never seen anything so different, and imaginative. It is very well done, and interesting. Nothing that anyone should miss seeing.
Positive	A little gem of a movie: Not as complex as my ten years ago memory of it recalled, but that's not a bad thing. This is a little gem of a movie which tells its tale with economy and verve.
Positive	(Panting sound): Whoa! This movie literally took my breath away. Its fast paced the whole time never letting up. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing. Forget the VHS get the DVD its cheaper and has extra scenes and interviews. The plot is like nothing ive ever seen before. Buy this and you won't regret it.
Positive	RUN out and get LOLA now!: So many people here have said so many great things about this startlingly original and innovative film that I'll just simply echo it all. From the music, which fits this film better than any soundtrack ever has before (the visual to music rhythm sync job is incredible), to the break all the rules camera work (not a single cross-cut or quick-cut was superfluous!), to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten. For myself, I'd say it's easily among the top 25 of this decade. Yes, it's that exciting, amazing, and original. I don't have a DVD player yet, but this will almost assuredly be my first purchase, even before THE MATRIX.
Negative	"Run Away, Run: Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run"""
Positive	Incredible! The best ever!: I rented this DVD online and was on the edge of my seat,glued to the screen and never blinked until the end! I hit title repeat right away and went amazon to buy one and gift-click four more to web friends.I will remember this film forever!If Run Lola Run was up for a little golden man it would expose the others as impotent,unoriginal bits of trash.
Negative	What a disappointment: My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!
Negative	"i dont fully comprehend the fascination with this movie: I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay. I thought the experimental ""and then"" parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the otherGroundhog Dayin how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though."
Positive	"It's creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people.: It's creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people. I can't see too deep a meaning from this ""music video with a plot"". Admittedly it's a must buy for it's originality."
Negative	"ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ: Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
Negative	Monotonous and annoying: If you like thumping, loud, monotonous music, you may like this film better than I did. With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation, I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time.
Negative	I cannot believe...: I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless...
Negative	Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it.: It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it.
Negative	"Ich weiß ja nicht !: Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir ""wie lange rennt die denn noch"" und ""warum rennt die schon wieder"". Mein Freundin fand den Film aber echt klasse. Von den vier Leuten die wir waren gibt einer 5 Sterne, 2 geben drei Sterne und ich gebe dem Film 2 Sterne. Würde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."
Positive	Run Lola Run - foreign film: It's like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Three days, lived over sequentially (same day) and this lady has to RUN across the city looking for a way to keep her boyfriend from being killed by the mob. Each time it ends in his death, then the last time she dies and he's the one who 'saves' her. Their next day completely shifts their life for the better & they're out of the perpetual loop.This actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape! Interesting premise. Fun watching the same people in the background in certain scenes where THEIR lives evidentally are very different each time around.I'd recommend it.
Positive	Good Movie: Yeah, its a foreign movie, but dont let that fool you. It was a good movie. Very different too.
Positive	Awesome Film: Get the German Version with the English Subtitles. Yes, the techo music gets annoying but it's a really good movie. You'll see lots of recurring themes of this in the near future. How everything you do, regardless of how small, has some impact on the rest of the world. There's a show on the Discovery channel called Connections with James Burke that details how everything is related to everything else. Yet it all appears to be a big mess of chaos. It's beautiful in it's insanity.
Positive	can't say enough good things about this movie: just incredible...The acting, directing, and pacing are all perfect! Watching this with the volume up is a surreal experience.Buy it! ;)
Positive	Fun, Fast and Beautiful: An amazing movie, not as fast and furious as people would have you believe, but breathtaking and suspenseful. Franka Potente is absolutely hypnotizing as Lola and the overall feel of the movie is romantic and fun. The dvd includes some fun extras, like Franka Potente's music video 'I Believe' and audio commentary by Franka and the director. Although translation is cumbersome sometimes, I would definately recommend the subtitled version over the dubbed(both are included on the dvd). In a word, astounding!
Positive	"Creative and Refreshing: This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It was fast pace and very entertaining. I really enjoy the ""ending."" The lead character Lola is awesome she is tough and also very feminine at the same time. I would highly recommend this film."
Positive	QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER: To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too.
Negative	Three words: empty, repetitive and boring: I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please.....
Negative	"What a waste!: ""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
Negative	Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola: I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring...
Negative	she never stops running: ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. yea well dnt watch this one cause u will just fall asleep and still not know the film is about her running and runninga and running and running and u get the picture
Negative	Run Money Run!: This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness.
Negative	running on empty: Her pusher boyfriend needs his junk, and his girlfriend missed the connection?Yeah? So what?Watch him get on the phone to her and freak out. Repeatedly.Just tired of films about drugs and users and that entire scene.Shot in that annoying MTV music-video style.When will directors learn to stop swirling the camera and allow the actors to do what they were hired to do?Not a complicated concept at all, filmmakers. Leave the actors alone. That's right: point the camera at them and let them show that they can act. How about that? If they can't act, hire someone who can--but please stop the idiotic camera tricks. Tony Scott does it, Tarantino does it, Robert Rodriguez does it... Why? Because they don't trust their minimal talent. That's exactly why.You're giving us a headache, man. Get it? If I want my brain to ache I'll take a rollercoaster ride.
Positive	This movie has it all: You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a movie or tv show or commercial that you like? Well, take all of those and put them in one movie and this is what Run Lola Run is - and they made it almost 10 years ago! If you haven't seen this, treat yourself and get it.
Positive	Perfect: If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you. It was easy to follow, and it had the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspence. For an added bonus they threw in some sweet techno music that you have to love.
Negative	Amelie on Acid: This pic reminds me a bit of Amelie, but much better. Amelie was cutsie and this is an action pic. Unfortunately, the running does get a bit tiresome, though it is interesting for much of its running time.
Positive	"Asolutely fantastic: ""Lola rennt"" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. I especially love it because it is none of the typical German Hollywood imitations which have flood the video market for years. Indeed I have never watched a similar film. It spreads hope and makes us realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own destiny and that we always should think before we act."
Positive	Dazzling German Cinema!: This fast-paced, innovative and extremely entertaining German film features an inspired techno soundtrack and great use of editing, camera and sound to tell the story of Lola (Franka Potente) who must figure a way to get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes. This is the excellent premise that shoots off an extremely clever and modern piece of foreign cinema. Great performance, great story, kinetic pace, excellent techno soundtrack and attentive direction make this film and it's filmmaker one of the most promising things to come out of Germany in the 90's. Highly Recommended. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!
Positive	RUN To The Video Store and Buy This: This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection.
Positive	German Film returns with a smash...: Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film. It is a fast paced heart pounder which leaves you lterally breathless afterwards. The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully. The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well. The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed. this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999. Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries. i hope to see more great exports soon!
Positive	I must add my voice: to those who are praising this movie. It is fun, it is profound, it is whimsical, it is confrontational--everything that Hollywood movies are not. It is the kind of movie that demands repeated viewings. A MUST BUY!
Positive	Direct Hit: This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed.
Positive	"Fabulous acting & soundtrack...you must see this movie!: I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think ""Sliding Doors"" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"
Negative	All style, no substance: There are so many good things in this movie that I really wish that I could've liked it more. But, as it is, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of a video game. If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders.
Negative	"""Different"" kind of movie!: I bought the dvd of this movie after I read all those positive feedback from other viewers. However, this is not the type of movie that I'll be willing to wait for more than a month for viewing. As an overseas buyer,the movie, shipment waiting time, and the cost of buying it all doesn't meet my high expectation/anticipation level of the movie. I was expecting something more like ""Le femme Nikita"" not a story of 2 youngsters having three different ending of their problems. The only good thing from this movie, for me, is the music! Two thumbs up for the music selection..."
Negative	A waste of time & money: I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German movie making.The use of cartoons takes much away from the story. I don't think I have patience to watch it againso I will probably trash it.
Positive	My Favorite Foreign Film: I usually don't like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings. (Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)
Positive	this is a must: this movie is like art. well-planned scenes and very sofisticated camera shots makes it a very beautiful movie. this is one of those must-have's that should belong among those classic movies that never fade with time.
Positive	"Ever Wonder ""What If"": Ever wonder ""What If""? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!"
Positive	Non-Stop Thrillride!: Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride! This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack. Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her. As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture. The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced! All in all, an excellent movie!
Positive	innovative piece of cinema: this is not the perfect film, however it is engagingly inventive and intelligent. the reality bending techniques (animated scenes, split second montages, and three separated sequences) expand the dimensions of cinema. no film in recent history has been able to break the norms of standard film so gracefully. if anything, it's worth renting, however it's not for everyone. it has a distinct taste that won't appeal to everyone. which is part of it's magic, it doesn't pander to what audiences want, it gives the audience what it needs: creativity.
Positive	"Fun Lola Fun: The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Of course, they want to kill him. Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money. And of course, she realistically doesn't have enough time to do it.What to do? Get the cash from Rich Banker Daddy? Steal the money? Win it?This is a Euro-slick film, shot like a music video. It asks, ""So she failed that time...but what if she tried it ANOTHER way?"" The audience follows Lola as she chases down the money...she does it again and again.Even though Manny is no choirboy, and Lola is not exactly Mother Teresa, you cheer for her and urge her on as the action speeds up. I liked Lola because she faces the problem head-on and then does what she's gotta do. The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy-handed angst European films so often get slammed for."
Positive	Captivating Indie: Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right. But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation. Without giving away too much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life.
Positive	The most unlikely scenario . . .: This is a good movie for learning German, since phrases are repeated from scenario to scenario. As for the plot:Supposedly, the third and final scenario is the true one. However, this is the most unlikely one. Somehow, in a city the size of Berlin, Manni is able to find the same homeless man who has his bag of money, and Lola gambles and wins 100 thousand DM, all in less than 20 minutes. The first two scenarios, in which Lola or Manni resorts to robbery and Manni or Lola is injured, are actually the more likely ones. Perhaps RUN LOLA RUN is poking fun at how neatly things usually turn out in movies.
Positive	What a fun movie!: I liked it. It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good. Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.I give this a big thumbs up!
Positive	Don't miss Lola !: This is a whole new experience in film. It's brilliant, innovative, and so much fun ! Fast paced, with a great pulsating score, it plays with time and shows you how a few seconds can change your life..the editing is a marvel, as well as the cinematography. (Love the ambulance/glass shot !). This incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings. It's a keeper !
Positive	Great Movie!: Great Movie! Really makes you think. It is based on the theory that every second of every day determins your ultimate fate and even if one second was different, it could change your whole life. There are twists and turns in this movie as Lola races to protect the destiny of her lover. Run Lola Run!
Positive	Run Lola Run: This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?
Positive	Had a blast!: This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended.
Negative	"One word: TRIPE: I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
Negative	HORRIBLE: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again.
Negative	"""I don't get it"" ""Nothing thought provoking"" ""Nothing Philosophical"": I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
Positive	European Film At It's Best: Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation.
Positive	excellent ....: Original - fun - breathless ... A film & a script very not conventional !! Great !! Not to miss ,,,,
Positive	A few more chances: If life could be that way, we were all having a few chances to make things right.
Positive	"A Running Movie: Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the ""real life"" which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!"
Positive	Simply spectacular!: 'Run Lola Run' was one of the best movies of 1999, IMHO. The creativity behind everything from the plot twists, to the music (the soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic!), to the animated cut-ins, to the soccer analogy absolutely blew me away! This movie is pure fun and excitement; don't miss it!
Positive	A near-perfect film.: Completely absorbing and hypnotising; this is the single best movie I have ever seen.
Negative	"This single is bad: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
Positive	"Worldview grounded in scripture: ""Creation Regained:Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview"" is not your typical worldview book. It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you."
Negative	Wrong book was deliverd: I received the wrong book in the mail. The right book needs to be sent. Still need the right copy
Positive	"WHATAREYA?: Chances are if yer not Australian yer not gonna understand TISM... from the band that brought you ""Defecate on my Face"" and ""There'll Never Be An Ole Man (River)"" comes their lastest. Tackling the hard issues... ""I might have screwed yer sister but I never screwed yer mum... I might have gone to uni but at least I know I'm dumb""... Yes.. they can rhyme with the best of 'em... but in the end its just good ole fashioned TISM! R U A YOB? nuh... yer a wanker... I'd actually say this was one of the best things out this year."
Positive	"Yank Ape hooked on TISM: I would never know about TISM if i didnt marry a Aussie...After hearing Ol'Man River(Machavelli & the four seasons)cd. I was hooked. (Wanker.com) is great in your face music and its got a beat thats nothing i can find in the states. Its a little tough for us Yanks to understand but all that I've made listen to it love it at first hear..the beat and the tunes you just cant stop singing...aka ""whatareya"" & ""yob"" and the second disk ""Aussie Guitar"" is great! hope to seem them soon..."
Positive	"Who then are TISM?: TISM (This Is Serious Mum) formed in around 1988 and became an overnight success with the release of He'll never be an Ol' man River and Greg the Stop sign in 1994. This is the latest in thier vengance on Australian society. Their fans arn't called fans but rather ""victims"" due to the fact that they are fanatics. They simply state that TISM are gods and all other bands are pop culture tools. Why? Well TISM sing about how pop music is regurgitated crap and that youth follow them like tools of the record companies. If you hate Hanson, Maryln Manson, and disco danc'n. You'll love TISM. Oh, and their into poetry, the condensending sarcastic type. Favourite song off this album; Whatareya?"
Negative	IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.: You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player.
Negative	Extremely Unreliable: I bought this product about 11 months ago. However, I've only been able to use it for about 6 months because it keeps malfunctioning. I had to ship it in twice for repairs at my own expense. This last time, they even forgot to ship back the memory card. Now I have to wait again...When it works, the product is great. However, it's so unreliable that it's not worth it. My recommendation is to buy another brand unless Compaq can get their act together.
Positive	I miss it...: This MP3 player served me well for two years until (because of my clumsiness) I broke it. It worked beautifully, able to play both MP3 and WMA files with ease. Loading files onto the player was a breeze, as was initial setup of the software. The headphones that it comes with are comfortable and have a good amount of volume capability. A great MP3 player, I'm now trying to find a replacement but am finding it difficult to find another that measures up. I miss you, my iPAQ.
Negative	the mark of the maker: The write-up was not good. This is definitely a children's book(?) Very disappointed.
Positive	"Good software to learn the basics: This CD is ""fast, fun & user friendly"" just like the good people at Talk Now say. It plays on both Windows and Mac computers. I recommend it for what it is. A beginner's learning tool for the essential words and phases. A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference. I just wish it covered even more of our Tagalog words. Just incase I forget them.hehehe"
Positive	Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it: My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good.
Negative	"Defective c/d's: What a disappointment. I was thrilled that Amazon carried this 2-set c/d, but when it arrived it was ""unplayable"". With it's usual efficiency Amazon provided a return label, and I re-ordered the product. The replacement too was unplayable. Obviously a manufacturing error. While I was very disappointed with the product, it renewed my confidence in Amazon to stand by their customer refund policy. This is why I buy everything I can through Amazon. You can't find a better guarantee on the internet, or anywhere else. Thanks Amazon."
Negative	Camera, yes - Camcorder, no: It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera, but not in my Sony camcorder. It gives a format error. I'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera. If I would have known that it would work only in the camera, I would have purchased the Sony Stick.
Positive	great subsitute for sony memory stick: Great subsitute for sony memory stick. cost less, same quality
Negative	More info needed: There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon
Negative	Two star because....: I haven't used it yet!!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous, wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it. Seriously, what a waste of resources. I can't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging. Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person!!!? ah!! For a MEMORY STICK? Gimme a break!!
Positive	I love the CD: For non-native speakers this is a God send, the CD provides both British and American pronunciation and I consider this is the most useful feature for this dictionary.Once you installed the CD to your hard drive in full installation mode, then store your CD in a safe place because you don't need it anymore.I highly recommend this to anyone who have a hard time to find how to pronoun the English words.
Negative	not enlightened: I was looking for a book that was a little more enlightened and a little less materialistic. This author clearly likes to shop (I am not a shopper), so it was hard to relate. Most of the ideas I have read before. I think the title is a little misleading. When I think about meaning, I think of higher ideals -- not just having more time to read a book in a quiet corner of my house. I don't know...I think if you have a strong sense of what brings meaning, you might find this book a bit superficial. Writing is good and there are good quotes too.
Positive	"This book can help you make money!: Incredible as it may sound ""Investing for Dummies"" was a realpage-turner! I read the entire book in several hours andactually gained some useful investing information. I have sincebeen able to make money in the three weeks since readingthe book. The recommended ""Dummies Approved"" lists are a greatresource. They act as good starting points for the novice toresearch investing ideas."
Positive	"When He Wrote Plays: American playwrights aren't good at creating a career of playwriting. Why, I can't say. They write dynamically for a given period and then off they go into putting the holy bible on stage or some such epic. They become mystics, like Allen Ginsberg. Shepard wrote plays for a while and then, I think, Hollywood put the zap on him and he was gone. His occasional pieces today are weak imitations of his former self. Money and fame may be responsible. Who knows? Here gathered in a single anthology are the key works, on which his life's reputation rests. ""True West"" sets the stage: we have real dramatic conflict, exciting dialog (of the sort last heard in Albee's ""Zoo Story""), and high theatricality. The rest of the anthology is well worth reading, but for my money Shepard wrote a fine short play but his long and longer pieces are less interesting. Shepard has said in interviews that he sees plays as an outlet for ideas. The problem as I see it is that he has none."
Positive	an incredible collage of beautiful plays: This collection of plays is extraordinary. Shepard threads tales of cartoonlike characters bound by the direst of circumstances excellently.
Positive	Great purchase: The book arrived on time and in good condition. This is an excellent collection for both theatre enthusiasts, teachers and for a comprehensive sampling of what Shepard is so gifted at constructing.
Positive	A Subpar Ripoff of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars: Seriously the art work, music and general theme reek of glam rock.But If you love Ziggy/Bowie and glam era its not bad, reminds me alot of the Velvet Goldmine movie for some reason for its sameless copying of bowies classic album. I picked this up around 1998 in a dumpster bin at a discount music store for probably around 99centsAnd its definately not the worst 99cents I've spent.Velventeen/Glitter Queen = Lady StardustShoeGazer = Ziggy Stardust
Positive	"This little piggy made the Mama giggle: I borrowed this book from my local library for my 4 yr. old who is in love with ""piggies""! She loved it, as did my 8 yr. old, who giggled and asked me to read it again. We liked it so much, we decided to purchase our own. The rhymes are funny and the illustrations are wonderfully drawn and entertaining. I must admit, I enjoyed it as much as they did."
Positive	Interesting Romantic Symphonic Music of a Russian Character: I remember reading somewhere that the Dahomeyan Rhapsody, though perhaps inspired by the West African nation, has a distinctly Russian flavor, and this is also certainly true of the symphony. Kalinnikov & Arensky came to mind as I listened to this piece for the first time, and as I listened more and thought less of Russian comparisons and more of De Boeck, the music still strikes me as Russian in the shapes of the melodies, the style of the orchestration, and in the development of the themes. I haven't as yet spent enough time with the violin concerto to feel adequate to advance an opinion, but can assuredly say that if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music you will probably enjoy the symphony and rhapsody, and the adverb 'probably' has no place in this sentence if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music from Russia. For in that case, you will certainly enjoy this music.
Negative	Boring to Read: Everytime I think of this book I feel to yawn. I was excited to get it but I have to admit I was very bored reading it. The secret of Mr. Hogan's swing was no secret at all. It may have been back then but not now. My apologies to the author. It is just my opinion.
Negative	Science lover: This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords.
Positive	A Must Buy!: Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this book! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this book. He shares with us the importance of disciple-making and how to do it correctly and systematically. He tells us what to look for in a potential disciple and the four progressive steps in the life of a Bible student: a convert, a disciple, a worker, and a leader. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of personal discipleship, this book is for you! Does anyone have his email or snail mail address? If so, please email it to me! Thanks.
Positive	great item: condition of book was great, better than the description, easy to read,recommended for every library, very in depth yet very simple
Negative	"Direct fit my a$$: After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala.This muffler is only 15"" long and does not compensate in any way for the factory 16"" muffler.I ended up with a total redneck rig installation. WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."
Positive	Very Good i loved it!!!!!!: i would give it 5 stars iloved that book i thought it was so goodthat i told my mom to go out and buy the book for me and now i am doing a reading fair project on it .If i could i would want to tell the author to please write anthor part to that book I did not think it should have been left off there. Well my name is Lindsey and i loved your book i am in 7th grade and asking please WRITE somemore!!!thanks Lindsey 13 Missississippi
Negative	Not worth the money: I bought the Alpha Diamante Cristalli Illuminating shampoo and conditioner, the first time I used it I didn't like the results but after the third time of use this product cause my haird to be extremely dry causing scabs on my scalp I discontinued but this was a waste of money and my hair is worse.
Negative	no blow: I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I've had did not ocilate. This one seems to reliably ocilate but even though it spins the blade it does not seem to move the air. jUNK DON'T BUY
Positive	A Must See Comedy: Flying dagger is one of the funniest movie I have seen this year. The main character in the movie seem weaker than Jimmy character. It seem that bad things always happen to the main character. As for Jimmy, he often get to do all the fighting. I think the girls in here are not good looking. Overall the movie have great comedy and the only good looking person in here have to be Jimmy Lin.
Negative	Kinda sux: I have had my case for 2 weeks and the leather is peeling off the binding center part. Also, the magnets don't line up right and I have to give it an adjustment to put the iPad to sleep. And last but not least, when I try to fold the cover back so it can stand, it always unfolds itself. If u want a smart cover, I would get the real thing.
Negative	THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!: This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!
Negative	waste of money: This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user.
Negative	Not much of value...: The closest to valuable information this book has is: The % of emails you received compared to the number of times your profile is viewed. There is nothing else here that isn't already listed on most dating web sites themselves. Don't waste your money, just read the information provided by the site(s) that you are a member of.It also appears that this book was sponsored by two specific companies (3 sites) as their name appears all over this book, and the 100's of other sites are ignored.I was surprised to see that this book was only written by two people. It has the disjointed feel of being written by a large group of people. It jumps from talking down to people only looking for sex, to praising how easily you can get sex, to talking down to people whom consider religious compatibility important. And that's just one example. I truly thought that it was written by at least five different authors, and edited by people who didn't speak to each other.
Negative	save your money: This book is little more than a pamphlet. It's written totally for men in the younger age brackets. I also bought and read I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book: A Commonsense Guide to Successful Internet Dating. That book is much better, and has much broader scope and depth. Save your money on this one.
Negative	"AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap...with horoscopes?: This brief 100 pages book wastes 25 pages on horoscopes, zodiac signs, what your sign says about you, what signs mean in women, what signs you should date. What do ancient superstitions have to do with the Internet and why does it consume 1/4 of the book? The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: ""some women are after money"" and ""if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father"" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage. The worst, avoid at all costs, even for free at the library. Horoscopes! Gawd."
Negative	Not reader worthy: I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree.
Positive	Trés Bien Céline: The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!
Positive	Céline is at her best in French!: Whenever people criticize me for being a Céline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille & 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer. The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs. Give it a try!
Positive	The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow: Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET
Positive	"AF - Absolutely Fabulous: Congrats Celine! Again. She made it. Another big success for releasing this new French CD. Debut #1 in Canada, and France. [...]Anyway, she has tried to sing a little bit more rock 'n' rolls kinda style this time. It's a good try for her, but I still like her ballad, and I highly recommend ""apprends-moi"" and ""je t'aime encore ""."
Positive	"1F4T: Cet album est chanté vraiment bien. Jean-Jacques et les autres ""types"" ont bien fait! Les chansons sont pas forte en vocales, mais les paroles sont très très émouvantes. Surtout ""Rien n'est vraiment fini"". ""Je Lui Dirai"", c'est le fun. Son premier 45 ""Tout L'Or Des Hommes"" place le feeling pour le reste de l'album. C'est super, a! Achète l'album! a vaut l'argent!"
Positive	Great CD: I love love love this CD. I dont speak french but its still great. I would recommend this CD to everyone.
Positive	Brilliant album but not the best of Celine: Excellent album but not as good as her earlier albums en Francais, in terms of the songs' melodies and lyrics. Yet it is still Celine.
Positive	For anyone who loves great vocals: I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she's singing about. Doesn't matter. This cd is amazing. And what is great is that you don't have to be her typical fan to like it. The production seems different on this cd. It's more of a low key affair but her vocal delivery will blow you away. Check out all the 5 star reviews this cd gets. This is one for a true music lover.
Negative	"Misleading Advertising: Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
Negative	Questionable quality: The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!
Negative	"False advertising: ""Hand decorated""...? Only if that phrase means cheap glued-on paper. I, too, purchased this item primarily for the chest. The chest arrived with the paper already peeling from all corners; on the lid are several raggedy-edged holes in full view. Really disappointing. Does anyone from Bentley actually read the advertising copy?"
Positive	Nice Gift: The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
Negative	Good tea/cheap chest: The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. However, the chest is very poorly put together. The applique material does not line up and there are numerous rough edges. Not wht I would want to display on the countertop.
Positive	Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest: This item is what it mostly says it is. Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale.
Positive	A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box: This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea. The tea is full of flavor and aroma. This made a great gift for me and will surely please the tea drinkers in your life as well. The box is also nice and my young daughter has plans to store little trinkets in it once it is empty.
Negative	"Product is fair quality and has poor description: I purchased the Dorman plug boot adapter and find them average in quality. I was looking to buy a ""SET"" of 4 for my 4 cyl Alero and was worried the picture shows only 2 boots but the price made me think it was for 4. the description never says it's for 2 but it's my fault for assuming there would be a complete set. Not real sure why anyone would buy only 2 when it makes for since to buy all 4 when servicing your auto. My bad I guess. Look around, for the price of these 2 boots (around 13 bucks when I bought them) you should be able to buy a complete set."
Positive	BIG RESULTS IN SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME: I do this video 2-3 times a week and find that I get as good a workout as doing almost 45 mins of freeweights. When I am done with this one, I feel my muscles burning. This is the first time I have seen anyone do a set of exercises one at a time and then incorporate them all together. YOu do a set of bicep curls, then lateral raises, overhead raises and tricep kickbacks. Then you do 2 of each all together. It was fun to do them that way. This tape goes really fast and I would recommend it to anyone who is short of time, but want to do some strength training.
Negative	Gossip Girl Season 3...: What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!
Negative	Did not get whole season: Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter's Christmans present turned out to be terrible. Make sure you check your cd's if you order these. They don't send you the whole season but want whole season $$$$. Bought it from Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. Of course I can't return it either.....
Positive	as described: Ordered for my stepdaughter for Christmas at her request.Arrived very quickly and new as stated.She has watched the series already and loves it - so will ahve to give this an A+.Thank you
